The other issue with the one massive zip file is theres no good way to resume on failed download (most of the zip will be recoverable but its not easily possible to go back and figure out which pictures werent included); and it fails for large files often because the connection timeout is shorter than it takes to transfer 15gb over wifi. Lame.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.phototransfer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Photo Transfer App</a> is great except it does not support delete (I contacted them and they say it is because on iOS apps are not allowed to delete user content; but I put in a feature request for their Android version - hopefully they implement it). Also \"backup\" mode must be used instead of \"download\" for large numbers of files because \"select all\" only selects the current page and the max page size is 400 files. Also all albums must be done separately (the Razr sometimes has 3 albums, two internal areas and the sd card).

Plus you have to remember to delete the thumbnails because the Android gallery does not refresh them accurately and provides no way to force a refresh (yet another UX win for Android). Scripts could theoretically be written on the PC side to automate this; <em>ideally</em> I'd avoid complex initial setup as well even though it does potentially reduce the task itself to one step.</li>\n<li>The suggestion below to copy photos then wipe the device...no</li>\n</ul>\n","viewcount":207,"dups":[],"title":"Move photos from Android to PC wirelessly *in one step*","tags":["wi-fi","photos","windows","data-transfer"],"userid":"67015","related":["48157","49306","48157"],"score":2,"answers":["77063","77103","77049","77014","77016","77021","77058"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-07-11T01:26:41.163","favoritecount":1,"comments":["100213","100214","100216","100217","100257","100271","100336","100893"]},"77009":{"body":"<p>I have purchased from China a mobile name HONMI H2. it was fine but, most of the applications were in Chinese.

There are lots of posts on the web that talk about the fact that unlocking your bootloader wipes apps and data - presumably to prevent unauthorized access to that info.  But in order to unlock the bootloader, you need adb access, and with adb access, any unauthorized person could get access to that data even with the bootloader locked.\n So, essentially, if you've enabled usb debugging, there's no security on this info once you plug the device into a computer. If that's true, the security rationale for wiping this data on unlock is a red herring, and seems mostly to be done to scare people away from unlocking, no?</p>\n\n<p>That said, I guess that raises the issue of whether you should leave usb debugging enabled on a dev mode phone. Also, does unlocking the bootloader open up other major security holes? Obviously allowing arbitrary kernels to boot could be a problem, but without entering your password on the lock screen and turning on adb access (or usb mounting), can somebody get access through the bootloader (or a flashed recovery module)?</p>\n\n<p>On my nexus one, usb access required you to okay it from the phone - i.e. you had to at least enter your lockscreen password in order to say okay.  Just got a nexus 4, and usb access is different - you get a choice between MTP or camera mode, but I don't remember being asked whether to grant access at all (don't have it with me to check).  But assuming it wouldn't be granted without the lockscreen password having been entered, I guess that's okay.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves the recovery module.  I guess anybody can get access to that, and a malicious user (even on a locked phone?) could restore the phone to factory settings and wipe all your data.  But could they use a custom recovery module to gain access to the data?  All they can do is flash any roms you've put out there, right? - can that mechanism be used to bypass lockscreen security.

Battery indicator is not a hardware related thing.. its a back ground service that is technically always running but is essentially always sleeping and using basically no system resources (because it doesn't do any polling -- it just sleeps and waits to be notified by the OS when something changes), then when the battery charge (or plugged-in status) changes, the system wakes it up and tells it what the new battery charge (and status) is.
