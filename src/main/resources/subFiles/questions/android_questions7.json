As a Computer Science major, I have elected not to immediately go the nuclear route of making drastic modifications to it, but have instead tinkered with it gradually over time. This is not entirely relevant in a material way, but helps put into context that which follows.</p>\n\n<p>The issue I am attempting to explain frustrated me very quickly, rapidly culminating in a factory reset, which has not solved the problem. It is (Android Version 2.2) (System version.2.3.20.A955.Verizon.en.US). There are very few apps currently installed on the phone. I first installed \"Pandora Radio\" by Pandora, \"Droidlight LED Flashlight\" by Motorola Inc, and \"Easy Profiles (Pro)\" by SmartDyne.</p>\n\n<p>The first marginally complex task I required of my phone was for it to keep track of dates and times for my college classes, as well as making note of when I receive advance notice of a class cancellation. In this regard, it seems to have failed me quite spectacularly.</p>\n\n<p>I elected to save my classes in my Google Account's Calendar, which my phone is capable of automatically synchronizing with. I assumed this was a task for which Android would be innately well-suited, but it appeared that the only Home Screen widget available to show Calendar events was a last-mile addition by Motorola, in the form of the \"Calendar\" app/widget, marginally effectively but very genuinely unimpressive. I access it via ...</p>\n\n<pre><code>(Home Screen) -&gt; [App Tray] -&gt; \"Calendar\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... and the correspondingly disappointing widget, accessible via ...</p>\n\n<pre><code>(Home Screen) -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; \"Add (+)\" -&gt; \"Motorola widgets\" -&gt; \"Calendar\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I elected to initially add all of my events in via my desktop running Firefox, for which Google has a satisfactorily robust interface. It allowed me to quickly and easily add in my classes, which repeat at their characteristic times, such as \"Every Monday and Wednesday\", which must be specified by hand. I then assumed my Droid 2 would be capable of synchronizing these events, displaying them via the Home Screen widget, and should a professor cancel a class, I presumed I would be able to delete that single occurrence of the repeating event from the calendar. If only that were the case.</p>\n\n<p>I am quite plainly unable to trust my Droid 2's Calendar's ability to remain accurate and up-to-date, an embarrassing shortcoming for a smartphone. When slight modifications to my calendar are made, such as the deletion of a single event from a repeating series, undefined behavior results, such as the disappearance of other events from the series. Deleting Monday's iteration of a class from my desktop will not remove it from my phone at all, while removing Monday's iteration of a class from my Droid 2 may result in Wednesday's corresponding class disappearing as well, only to spontaneously reappear the following Monday.</p>\n\n<p>I first sought to troubleshoot that it wasn't simply the \"Calendar\" app/widget distributed by Motorola, and installed another third party calendar app/widget, electing to try the \"Android Agenda Widget\" by \"Everybody all the time\" from the Market. The two existed side-by-side for a while, and it was interesting to note that the inconsistencies continued in both widgets, and the two calendars always displayed identical data.</p>\n\n<p>I have discovered a way to very plainly view all of these inconsistencies in real-time as they occur. I can access my Google Account's Calendar data through the mobile browser, by navigating to \" <a href=\"https://m.google.com/app#~calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://m.google.com/app#~calendar</a> \". This view, while grossly inefficient for any real work, has always remained free of any of the inconsistencies seen elsewhere on the device, and has always remained accurate to the view from a desktop browser.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have reason to believe, at this point, that the error results in an inconsistency between the way Google delivers my calendar information to the phone, and the data structure my phone currently uses to store the information, and that this single data-structure is the sole source of calendar data for any Calendar app/widget I might install from Market. I believe that the structure was designed very specifically for the then-current iteration of Google's Calendar data, which has since widened. This is, however, purely speculative based on the behavior of the interfaces, and backed by no hard data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I've said, the inconsistencies are wild, and the issue, while prevalent, has proven difficult to reliably reproduce. In addition to the issues listed above, using my phone to adjust a classes' start time by 15 minutes once caused the entire repeating series to disappear forever, while another time, using the \"Calendar\" app by Motorola to add a fifteen minute warning notification for a specific occurrence resulted in <em>every. single. Calendar. event. period.</em> to spontaneously disappear from my phone.</p>\n\n<p>I am at my wit's end as how to bring the behavior of my phone back into line, and appeal to you for help. Before bringing my objections to light, I was willing to try a nuclear option, such as flashing a different ROM, but my inexperienced Google searches have yielded no more than one or two walkthroughs for flashing the Droid 2, and none of the available ROMs seemed particularly impressive, rife with their own bugs and misfeatures, and there is no available distribution of Gingerbread for my hardware, which was exceptionally disappointing. The locked bootloader of the Droid 2 seems to be the primary cause of this unavailability. It is genuinely discouraging to see the open nature of Android compromised by such hostile hardware design.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: @Matt asked me about my Autosync options.

I want my phone to work over USB and with AFT for a reason (speed, convenience, and better synchronization). Kies seems to be the default suggestion to solve this issue, but it is terribly buggy and it accomplishes file transfer much the same way that nuking my house would get rid of spiders.

It upsets me greatly, especially since I recently purchased a $300 set of Bose headphones (Quietcomfort 20) that are specifically made for Android devices. I've even tried three apps from the Google Play store that purport to make the inline control work—none of them do, however. Why is this happening and, more importantly, how can I fix this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>07/30/2014 EDIT:</strong><br>\nSo I've been using this Moto X plus QC20 headphones for several months now, using the recommended <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outsidesource.klipschcontrol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klipsch Control app</a> to allow the button on the QC20 to work better. Well, it only seems to work about 50% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>I have yet to figure out what is causing the interference, but some days, the button works perfectly. Other days, it will work, but it may take anywhere from 0 to 15 seconds before a button press is actually registered by the Klipsch Control app. It just seems to be completely random. Still other days, the button doesn't work at all.</p>\n\n<p>It might have something to do with either the time of day and/or when the headphones are plugged in / removed. For example, one morning, it'll work fine. Then I unplug the headphones and go to lunch. Returning from lunch, I plug the headphones back in and the button no longer works. Or the reverse could be true: The button doesn't work before lunch, but works great after.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this odd behavior, I'm sure you can see why I am fearful of unplugging the headphones for the rest of the day once the button on them starts working. I know that if I unplug them and plug them back in later, I only have a 50% chance of the button working.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense. More importantly, I hope someone can see some sort of pattern that I have yet to see in this behavior to identify the cause(s) of this problem.

Interestingly, it worked. But, after using it for a while (precisely 1-2 days), \"Onavo Count\" started to warn me again about that email client consumes too much traffic. While investigating the problem, I've noticed that for a single check, it consumes 1-3 MiB traffic even though I've marked all messages as read.

The excerpt from the article in question here is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All these screen dimming/color cast applications function in\n  essentially the same way: by overlaying a graphic on the screen to\n  reduce the brightness and/or change the color cast of the screen.\n  Think of it like adding a partially opaque layer to an image in\n  Photoshop. When you tell the Lux application, for example, that you\n  want the screen 50 percent dimmer than the actual hardware in the\n  phone can provide via LED adjustments, the application essentially\n  cheats by layering a gray mask over the screen that decreases the\n  brightness because the screen elements are darker. Other apps like\n  Screen Adjuster, Darker, Easy Eye, Twilight, and even the brightness\n  adjustment function in popular battery-saving app JuiceDefender all\n  work the same way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>So if the screen brightness applications (like Lux) only add a partially opaque layer they are essentially not dimming the backlight (<em>correct me if I am wrong here</em>) so in turn it would not have any affect in battery life. Right?</p></li>\n<li><p>The article continues saying – <em>Anything that layers something over the screen in anyway disables the “Install” button as the button is rendered unclickable in order to prevent malicious software from creating a false overlay that leads the user to think an application has a different set of permissions or that the application is an entirely different app altogether</em>. So does reducing the screen brightness via Settings uses some other technique (probably it actually reduces the backlight)?</p></li>\n</ol>\n","viewcount":88,"dups":[],"title":"How does reducing brightness of screen increase battery life?","tags":["applications","screen-brightness"],"userid":"30106","related":["69196"],"score":3,"answers":["82322","82314"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-09-10T12:55:34.347","favoritecount":0,"comments":["105434","105524"]},"65297":{"body":"<p>I am connected to the internet via an ethernet cable on my laptop pc.

After following the steps the first time, nothing happened to the phone's interface, so I did it a second time. This time, when it rebooted at the end of the installation, It got past the first two screens (name of model, and just \"Samsung\"), then it turned off.</p>\n  \n  <p>What I've tried so far: First I tried applying the stock images (about 10 Mb, from <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34463311#post34463311\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34463311#post34463311</a>) through ODIN, but that made no difference, except that in one of the boot modes, instead of the Clockwork interface I, get the default interface (the background having an Android alien on its back, and a red triangle with an exclamation point above it). In these interfaces, I also wiped pretty much all that I could wipe, but to no avail.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next I tried applying two of the stock ODIN images (500-600 Mb, from the same link) through ODIN, but when it starts with the SMD, I get a message \"SMD header check fail: boot.img\" on my phone, and ODIN thinks for a while, then stops, saying 1 fails and 0 successes.</p>\n  \n  <p>So here I am, asking for help. Would any of you have any ideas, or explanations (in layman's terms!) of what has happened / what I should do to get my phone useable again? Thanks in advance.</p>\n  \n  <p>P.S.

They were right, the back plastic is very delicate (and snapped in two places, purely cosmetic though). It's fairly tidy inside, and the battery and guts are easily exposed. My attempt to read the voltage of the battery revealed it to be.. basically dead. No real voltage at all. My best guess at this point is that somehow the charging circuitry requires some kind of minimum current available in the battery before it will attempt to charge it (or perhaps enough to boot and allow the software to handle it). Seems pretty stupid to me. If I can get my hands on a replacement battery, or a something to charge the existing battery directly, <strong>OR</strong> a wall wart to provide the 3.7 volts directly, I will try that.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, looks like I'm totally SOL and I'd have better luck posting into the Hack-a-day QA forums than a respectable software specific support forums like Android Enthusiasts. Thanks again guys! Maybe I'll be back again later for assistance getting Ubuntu installed on my Droid 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FINAL EDIT!:</strong>\nAfter a quick jaunt over to Hackaday, I got some confirmation that the actual read voltage across my battery terminals was BELOW the minimum for Li-Ion, so they battery was basically dead. Another quick run to ebay found me a \"new\" one for ~$35. 5 days later and I shoehorned the new battery in and tada! It works! .. sort of. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the undue stress of being discharged (or perhaps being so lonely), the boot process was broken and it was stuck in an endless boot loop. AFter about 4 hours messing with it trying this method to do fastboot and user wipe, but finding out that windows failed to recognize the it as anything but \"Unkown Device\", after another 2 hours of hacking around i come to find out it's my horrible cheap chinese knockoff cable that's the culprit!!</p>\n\n<p>Found the original cable, plugged it in, fastboot works, try to wipe with fastboot -w, just hangs. Fooey. Next I follow <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYBs98R9rTs&amp;feature=relmfu\">this unbrick method</a> using the odin download to flash a \"Stock\" rom. This works! Yay!!! Unfortunately it's back to android 3.2... but I can't complain, as I am now the proud owner of a $35 (+ 10 hours of work) android tablet.</p>\n\n<p><em>What</em> an adventure.

The last ota I need to install downloads via the update service, but fails with errors upon install. I also downloaded the ota manually via the xda forums nabi 2 wiki page and tried to install from the sd card but that fails too. (maybe as my UK stock with serial device, is now a US stock with no serial device, which is causing a signature fail during install of the latest ota?). The device is no longer rooted, so no shell r/w access. I cannot see the device in fastboot. Using the command 'reboot recovery' reboots the device but then it freezes up and is no longer seen via usb. When 'Fastboot recovery' option is chosen in &lt;3e> recovery the device locks up, and the same thing happens when choosing 'Forced recovery'. All signed recovery .zips I have tried to install through &lt;3e> recovery fail with the message 'file verification failed'.</p>\n\n<p>I'm kinda going round in circles with this... I know I need to root to get TWRP back, which allows a custom kernel/recovery to be used, but as I have no Su permission I have no r/w privileges to install the super user files and/or recovery image files to the necessary places. So unless there is some way to get the required recovery files onto the device by the adb command without su access (I'm doubtful of), or via a modded/signed recovery image zip file within &lt;3e> recovery (which again I'm doubtful of, as other signed .zips fail), I'm guessing that the device is bricked?</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback to help solve/answer will be gratefully appreciated.</p>\n","viewcount":435,"dups":[],"title":"Fuhu Nabi 2 tablet bricked <3e> recovery","tags":["unbricking"],"userid":"57819","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["66936"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-03-31T21:41:21.753","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"66633":{"body":"<p>So I got a new phone (Moto G) about 3 days ago (newest version os) and I've tried to connect to my school's internet, which requires usename/id and password.

In general terms, the phone is pretty smooth, very responsive - haven't seem an android phone this smooth in a while. I'm pretty happy with it.

Here is a screenshot of the \"ALCATEL Dream Composite ADB Interface\" properties.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/dqGHA.png\" alt=\"&quot;ALCATEL Dream Composite ADB Interface&quot; properties\"></p>\n\n<p>It seems as if this attempt was not helpful. I leave it anyways in case someone stumbles into the same situation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>The solutions</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Strange! I installed almost all available API Versions in the Android SDK Manager and now also selected the images for ARM, Intel and MIPS. The result is that the device is recognized on Windows.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ucdul.png\" alt=\"Android Device Chooser\"></p>\n\n<p>I tried hard to <strong>undo</strong> the driver installation on Windows. To me, the most obvious is removing the \"Google USB Driver\". So I did and restarted Eclipse and the computer but still Windows remembers the maker and model. I further tried to remove other items <strong>without success</strong>. I will leave my experiments in this question for others to <strong>figure out</strong> the key installation module needed on Windows to recognize the device. I guess its \"Google USB Driver\" and the <code>.inf</code> file has been copy to the Windows system folder in the background.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ubuntu:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Regarding Ubuntu, I like to grant the answer Flow (please put your comment as an answer). I configured a device rule as it has been <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3429959/why-is-eclipses-android-device-chooser-not-showing-my-android-device/4079361#4079361\">explained by vsm and others</a>. There is also an official guide entitled: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up\" rel=\"nofollow\">Setting up a Device for Development</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Speculations</h1>\n\n<p>It could be that when I tried to update the Windows driver with the USB driver from Alcatel that it actually updated my system without telling me. All I received was the message \"Driver version is up-to-date\". I missed to check the version before I started. If anyone can verify this theory on a \"clean\" system I happy to hearing from you.</p>\n","viewcount":12847,"dups":[],"title":"How can I get ADB to properly recognize an Alcatel One Touch 995 device on Windows/Ubuntu?","tags":["adb","usb-drivers"],"userid":"16349","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["34482","34382"],"acceptedanswer":"34482","creationdate":"2012-11-29T19:34:17.133","favoritecount":0,"comments":["44481","44487","44490","44619"]},"57212":{"body":"<p>My Nexus 4 screen broke.

First off, I have a Samsung Infuse 4G with AT&amp;T. I was able to lock onto satellites indoors pretty quickly before. So I rooted my phone with SuperOneClick last night, and everything was good. No problems. However, I was having trouble replacing my recovery file with a modified recovery file. So after some research, I came across Odin on XDA Developers(http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1092021&amp;page=8), that was supposed to do exactly what I wanted: Flash me to a stock ROM with root and modified recovery. It was a successful flash, except for one little problem. Any application that used the GPS hardware would fail to initialize. So \"luckily\" for me, the thread I flashed to root+modified recovery also had a 100% stock ROM to flash my hardware with, so I did that. However, I had the same issue still of not being able to run GPS dependent programs. So I did a manufacturer's reset, and now every application will initialize and run, however I can't LOCK into satellites now! I've tried using GPS status to clear and download AGPS data with no luck. I've tried several different supl servers, including google and nokia, no luck.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is my fault, but can somebody help me out of this mess? The only sort of location that works on my phone is mobile/wifi location.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help I get.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It appears that even though I flashed a 100% stock rom to my device, there are GPS locking issues with the rom.
