First off, I have a Samsung Infuse 4G with AT&amp;T. I was able to lock onto satellites indoors pretty quickly before. So I rooted my phone with SuperOneClick last night, and everything was good. No problems. However, I was having trouble replacing my recovery file with a modified recovery file. So after some research, I came across Odin on XDA Developers(http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1092021&amp;page=8), that was supposed to do exactly what I wanted: Flash me to a stock ROM with root and modified recovery. It was a successful flash, except for one little problem. Any application that used the GPS hardware would fail to initialize. So \"luckily\" for me, the thread I flashed to root+modified recovery also had a 100% stock ROM to flash my hardware with, so I did that. However, I had the same issue still of not being able to run GPS dependent programs. So I did a manufacturer's reset, and now every application will initialize and run, however I can't LOCK into satellites now! I've tried using GPS status to clear and download AGPS data with no luck. I've tried several different supl servers, including google and nokia, no luck.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is my fault, but can somebody help me out of this mess? The only sort of location that works on my phone is mobile/wifi location.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help I get.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It appears that even though I flashed a 100% stock rom to my device, there are GPS locking issues with the rom.
