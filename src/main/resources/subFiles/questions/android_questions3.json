I just went through all of my apps and documented which ones are on SD storage and phone storage. I was then able to go through my list of updates and select just those that are on phone storage and then all succeeded (11 apps). I then went through some of the ones on SD storage and they all failed (tried 7, but I probably have 10-15 more).</p>\n\n<p>I have tried many of the \"fixes\" I've seen online like clearing the cache on the Market app. There is not enough internal space for all my apps. I refuse to accept some of the \"fixes\" as true fixes like deleting the app and reinstalling it or moving the app to the phone storage, updating, and then moving back. Those are not acceptable fixes in my book. This is a major black eye on the Android OS to me. When people ask me if Android is as good as iOS, this problem is front and center in my mind when I tell them that its good, but I'd rather have an iPhone (but, I'd rather have this than my old Blackberry). I get my phone through work, so rooting is not an option. Has anybody else had any success resolving this issue?

In TWRP recovery console - I am able to access and push files to and from /sdcard folder with no problems, and see its content with adb shell.</p>\n\n<p>When android loads - <code>cd /sdcard</code> + <code>ls</code> shows that it is empty (even though it does contain files copied to it in recovery console mode) the reason for this is that with ls I can see that <code>/sdcard</code> points to <code>/storage/emulated/legacy</code> which points to <code>/mnt/shell/emulated/0</code> which DOES NOT exist. <code>/mnt/shell/emulated/</code> folder exists, but it is empty.</p>\n\n<p>I am unable to use the device - just start the OS (and get the error messages when trying to launch applications). When the OS loads I immediately get the \"unfortunetley, google play store has stopped\" error without doing anything.</p>\n\n<p>running google earth application when logcat active gives the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>E/cutils  (10727): Failed to chmod(/mnt/shell/emulated/0, 0): Read-only file system\nE/dalvikvm(10727): cannot mountExternalStorage(): Read-only file system\nI/ActivityManager(  492): Start proc com.google.earth for activity com.google.earth/.EarthActivity: pid=10727 uid=10024 gids={50024, 3003, 1015, 1028}\nD/dalvikvm(10727): No JNI_OnLoad found in /system/lib/libearthmobile.so 0x41dc5158, skipping init\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea how do I solve this?

Late last week I started looking into it and I found out, much to my utter horror, that it wasn't my company's server that was at fault, it was the IM app's server -- I have been logging in to my company's server through their server for months now, meaning that their server had access to my password (which can be used for just about every system I use at work).  I verified this by rooting my phone, installing WireShark and looking at the network traffic.</p>\n\n<p>I've asked for my money back, since I paid for the app, but I really want to get the app removed from the marketplace, as it's a huge danger to anyone using it.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I have no proof that this company was harvesting anyone's password, but they could be doing it.  Regardless, they're transmitting my login credentials in the clear (though they are encoding the password, which I'm sure will deter all but the most hardened hackers -- not!).</p>\n","viewcount":146,"dups":[],"title":"How to \"report\" a mis-behaving app?","tags":["google-play-store"],"userid":"135","related":[],"score":7,"answers":["3580","3586"],"acceptedanswer":"3580","creationdate":"2010-12-12T23:50:23.197","favoritecount":1,"comments":["3452","3475","3478"]},"75039":{"body":"<p>I'm trying to update my Nexus 4 from 4.4.2 to 4.4.3 and every time the message pops up, I select install and clockworkmod recovery keeps saying error, installation aborted, STATUS 7.

It assigned me an i/p address and thus made it work but spoiled it for my other housemates, so I had to get the setting back to WEP.I know it is more secure to use WPA, but I cannot change it without asking my landlord.

These apps' primary purpose is managing to do lists and projects, but they have secondary minor features that use these permissions (I think it is for scheduling responses to missed calls and sharing tasks by SMS).</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to allow any non-official app on my phone to make phone calls or send SMS. It's just not something I need 3rd party apps to do for me, and I'm not interested in these secondary features. The developers look reasonably legit - but I generally prefer not to feel like I'm unneccessarily handing a company I don't know an open wallet. But I would, ideally, like to be able to use these apps for their primary features, which appear to be very good and better than the competition for what I want. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to download these apps and prevent these permissions from being used?

Likewise for custom ROMs.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mind if it's a blunt solution that stops any app except the Android phone interface itself from making calls or sending SMS. In fact, that would be ideal. I thought about trying to use an app like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tasker</a> to set up a trigger on any ongoing call or SMS that cancels it if it wasn't called directly by the Android phone interface, but I doubt that it would work (and of course Tasker uses these permissions itself...).</p>\n\n<p>Also ideally I'd prefer not to need to spend lots of time in airplane mode unable to receive normal calls or messages - but I'll accept a strong solution that involves using airplane mode some of the time if there is no better approach.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't mind if a solution causes the app to crash or force close any time it tries to use one of these permissions.

Now the same issue is back after installing <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stericson.permissions.donate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Permission Denied</a>, or this is rather when I noticed that the issue was back, as I'm not entirely convinced that this was caused by installing this app as this issue was already present earlier (I tried if uninstalling Permission Denied made any difference but it did not) and it is now persistent. I even ended up restoring all pre-installed \"system\" apps with Titanium Backup. Though restoring the gapps failed, which I then partially restored using the Backup app that came with my phone and by reinstalling directly from play store. However the issue is still present after restoring/reinstalling all previously uninstalled apps and clearing google play's and google play service's caches and wiping data. And I've only removed gapps which are available in the play-store to begin with (Chrome, Google Play Movies, Google Play Books, Google Play Music, Google+, Hangouts, Google Play Newsstand) and also only those, which were save to remove according to other user's experience with this device. The only other apps I removed was a homescreen gadget by Huawei and a DLNA app by huawei. Now I believe that this isn't really related to removing pre-installed apps at all (I listed the system apps I uninstalled regardless, in the case that it may still be important) and now I am kind of at a loss as I've already tried everything that came to my mind and googling didn't get my any further either. I still have a backup of my ROM before rooting, of course but I'd rather not go through the hassle of reflashing and setting up everything again, especially as I do not even know what has caused the issue to begin with and I'd like to avoid it in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong> How do I get my phone back to properly reboot without first having to kill the google play process manually in settings?</p>\n\n<p>Any help with fixing this would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n","viewcount":763,"dups":[],"title":"Rooted Huawei Ascend Y300 reboot fails when play store process is opened","tags":["google-play-store","4.1-jelly-bean","reboot"],"userid":"50120","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-04-04T23:36:19.843","favoritecount":0,"comments":["90429","90574"]},"66912":{"body":"<p>And also I plugged my phone in but kingo root won't recognize it and it says connection to server failed</p>\n","viewcount":249,"dups":[],"title":"Does kingo root trigger knox on s4?","tags":["samsung-galaxy-s-4","samsung-knox"],"userid":"57658","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["67011"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-04-04T23:09:34.170","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"66911":{"body":"<p>I'm still learning about VPNs so forgive me if this sounds horribly mistaken, but if I understand it correctly a VPN is an encrypted internet connection between two computers that can also be used as proxy.
