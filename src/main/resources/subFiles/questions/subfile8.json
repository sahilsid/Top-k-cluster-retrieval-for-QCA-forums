{"58021":{"body":"<h3>General question</h3>\n\n<p>I have an app X installed on my device in version Y. I don't want to update it to any newer version (Y+z) for some reason. Still, the <em>Google Play Store</em> app always lists updates for X, which keeps me from a simple \"update all\". My question, put to a single sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>How to hide updates for X permanently from the \"available updates\" list?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Specific examples</h3>\n\n<p>First, I know there are alternatives as e.g. the <a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/appbrain-app-market/com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.apps\">AppBrain Market App</a>, which can handle this quite well (skip this update, skip all future updates). I prefer a \"generic solution\", which does not depend on a 3<sup>rd</sup> party's market app.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I know that <a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/titanium-backup-%E2%98%85-root/com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\">Titanium Backup</a> includes a \"Market doctor\", which can be used to disconnect an app from <em>Google Play</em>. However, in my specific case that only worked for a few hours: I disconnected <em>GTalk</em>, as I don't want it replaced by <em>Hangouts</em>. The update notification disappeared for a few hours, then it was back. No idea what restored the \"link\".</p>\n\n<p>Third, just to make sure: I'm <em>not</em> talking about the \"auto update\" feature as discussed e.g. in <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/50681/16575\">How to enable Play Store auto-update for just a few apps?</a>. I was rather hoping for something close to <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/35794/16575\">Does the google play store not provide updates for frozen apps?</a>, but without the need to \"freeze\" the app in question (which I still want to use, but in the version installed, not in a \"future version\" available).</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: No, uninstalling the app in question is no option here, though it would perfectly hide any future updates from being displayed :) Nor is \"freezing\", as the app is used regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth: There is a related question for my GTalk example: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/31928/16575\">Do apps included in the gApps zip get updated via Google Play?</a> However, I want the opposite: No update.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It might very well be that \"Google Apps\" (and other pre-installed apps) are handled in some specific way, and restore their \"market links\" themselves somehow. For this case, my question includes: How to prevent that from happening?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Update</h3>\n\n<p>There's a <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2399472\">thread at XDA</a> discussing the very same issue. Until recently, a work-around for \"user installed apps\" was to uninstall them and then sideload the <code>.apk</code> – but even that stopped working. Well, re-signing the <code>.apk</code> with a different key <em>might</em> work for user-apps. But both would fail for pre-installed apps (can't sideload them to override; different signature would refuse that install completely).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there's an <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27431\">issue filed</a> on this by some \"joel.bou..\". Not hard to guess, though blanked out: that would be Joël Bourquard. If it's really him, then that's really an issue (for those who don't know: Joël is the dev behind <em>Titanium Backup</em>). Let me quote from the issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the record: in the Android Market days it was possible to \"Attach\" or \"Detach\" apps (on rooted devices) with a system tool such as Titanium Backup. But nowadays (with the Google Play Store app) this has become nearly impossible to do, because the complete app list seems to sync from Google's servers and the user has no control over that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which explains why detaching with apps like <em>Titanium Backup</em> is no longer permanent. And I'm afraid I've asked the impossible. But I thought the same in the past with other questions, and surprisingly got solutions here. So I do not yet give up hope on this one!</p>\n","viewcount":1664,"dups":[],"title":"How to get rid of update notifications for a given app in Google Play Store?","tags":["google-play-store","update"],"userid":"16575","related":["39180","50681","35794","31928"],"score":9,"answers":["59485"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-30T16:16:01.887","favoritecount":4,"comments":["78742","78744"]},"58026":{"body":"<p>I have a home linux server running the PulseAudio - with shared audio devices, that are connected to cool sound system.</p>\n\n<p>And I have an Android 4.4-based phone.

My first thought was that it was not a good idea. Sometimes you want to keep the original, untouched image, as well as the modified image, maybe for comparison purposes, or to try different filters or settings. In my case I was playing with the curves, and then I saved the image. I wanted to compare the new image with the original, but the original was gone. I decided to go back to the curves settings, and saw that the curves were still as I had set them, which means I can just restore the curve for each channel and that will give me back the original image.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to do a test with another image. I opened a new image, applied a filter from the preset filters, and saved the image. Then I went back to the image, and edited it again, but this time I removed the filter, and the image was back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was that the gallery image applied non-destructive edits. Something similar to what some editing software does. The one that comes to mind is Shotwell, although this is more of a viewer than and editor, but it has some limited functionality to play around with the saturation, levels, and other settings. It didn't seem likely that the gallery application in adroid was doing that because other image viewing applications showed the image with the filter applied to it.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to connect the device to the computer using a USB cable. I navigated to the camera folder, and opened the image in the computer, and it showed the modified image. This means that the image is being modified.

I had thought it was just because I had been listening to music a lot more that day, but then when I checked the battery app that night it said that Google Maps was responsible for <em>half</em> the battery drain.

I'm assuming the former because there's no CPU activity, just GPS.

I ask this because our app has a status bar on top and we could possibly move it to the bottom and change the icons and functionality of the status bar to match the app's status bar so no screen real estate is lost.</p>\n\n<p>I have read that 4.2 adds some fullscreen functionality for apps.

So far, I've observed the following:</p>\n\n<p>My BIONIC often refuses to get a 3G data connection back when switching from Wi-Fi or 4G back to 3G. If I switch to Airplane Mode and back, sometimes I'll get the 3G connection back, sometimes I won't. In the About Phone -> Status menu, it says the mobile data network is \"connecting.\" Sometimes I end up having to reboot.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, when attempting to use the phone in CDMA-only mode, the phone seems to decide to drop its 3G connection at random and refuse to get it back - even on reboot the phone is slow to acquire signal. I noticed a similar problem on the DROID Charge.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any theory as to why this is happening? Do all Verizon's LTE phones share a common chipset model? Because it sounds to me like whoever makes the chipset is doing a real bang-up job of shipping phones with near-defective radios or radio firmware. As it appears to happen across <strong>three different manufacturers</strong>, the buck falls on Verizon and their LTE chip partner.

This probably happens because the dictionaries include only the lowercase versions of the words, while automatically uppercasing them on demand to save store space or to avoid what they perceive as duplication. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, although lowercase greek vowels may carry an accent, uppercase ones must not do so. More importantly, the 7-bit GSM-ASCII encoding for SMS transmission that allows for 160 characters per SMS only includes uppercase Greek characters without accents (it does not include lowercase ones). As soon as a single lowercase or accented uppercase character is typed, the SMS must be sent using UCS-2 encoding which is 16-bit and limits us to 70 characters per SMS.</p>\n\n<p>The list of characters and their replacements is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ά =&gt; Α\nΈ =&gt; Ε\nΉ =&gt; Η\nΊ =&gt; Ι\nΌ =&gt; Ο\nΎ =&gt; Υ\nΏ =&gt; Ω\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would anyone have any idea how to go about doing this, in an existing app or some sort of macro with string replacement functionality? </p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the long question, if you reached this far. I thought it was important to state the background that lead to this limitation. Thanks in advance.</p>\n","viewcount":900,"dups":[],"title":"When typing, automatically replace specific characters with others (ie accented uppercase Greek vowels)","tags":["sms","keyboard","tasker"],"userid":"4497","related":[],"score":6,"answers":["48884","32107"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-10-19T18:46:27.050","favoritecount":0,"comments":["65753"]},"57772":{"body":"<p>I updated my Nexus 4 to KitKat.
