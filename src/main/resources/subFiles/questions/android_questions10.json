As in that question, some device info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's a BLU ADVANCE 4.0</li>\n<li>Board is Mediatek MT6572</li>\n<li>Android version is 4.2.2</li>\n<li>Kernel version is 3.4.5</li>\n<li>I do have root access</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've been trying to take a backup of certain partitions on my phone (boot.img, system.img, recovery.img) but I've run into some problems.</p>\n\n<p>I've found backups online for this model, taken backups with MTK Droid Root and Tools and tried to read directly from /dev/bootimg and /dev/recovery. I've run into a few different issues. There are three main ones and I include them all here as I think they're related. I'm going to start with the one that's consistent across all of these:</p>\n\n<h2>Issue #1</h2>\n\n<p>The kernel part of my boot.img seems to be way too small (about 18.0KiB - that's not right, is it?) and ends with a bunch of error messages before the GZIP 1F8B that I think marks the start of the ramdisk. Here are the messages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System halted.\nAttempting division by 0!...\nUncompressing Linux.....\ndecompressor returned an error.. \ndone, booting the kernel...\ninvalid distance too far back...\ninvalid distance code...\ninvalid literal/length code.\nincorrect header check..\nunknown compression method..\ninvalid window size.invalid block type..\ninvalid stored block lengths....\ntoo many length or distance symbols.\ninvalid code lengths set....\ninvalid bit length repeat...\ninvalid literal/lengths set.\ninvalid distances set...\nincorrect data check....\nOut of memory while allocating output buffer....\nOut of memory while allocating input buffer.\nOut of memory while allocating z_stream.\nOut of memory while allocating workspace....\nNot a gzip file.\nheader error....\nread error..\nuncompression error........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The newlines are from me, I tried to format it as best I could. I'm a little confused about what's going on here as I'm just reading the image - there shouldn't be error messages. Am I just seeing lists of possible errors in the kernel?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Issue #2</h2>\n\n<p>I can't extract the contents of the ramdisk in the properly sized kernels (I want to check that the backups worked properly) as in <a href=\"http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=HOWTO%3a_Unpack,_Edit,_and_Re-Pack_Boot_Images.\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guide to unpacking boot images</a>\nWhen I run this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gunzip -c ../your-ramdisk-file | cpio -i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the following messages (a whole bunch like the first and finishing with the last two):</p>\n\n<pre><code>cpio: Malformed number (�K�����\ngzip: ../ramdisk.gz: decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored\ncpio: premature end of file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and no new file outputted. Note that I can unzip the file by omitting the cpio bit and redirecting the output and it will produce a file containing some recognizable text in a hex editor, so I assume the extraction was successful.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Issue #3</h2>\n\n<p>The boot.img read from /dev/bootimg, though it seems to be valid at the start, is way, way too big - I stopped it at 3.0GiB+. For reference the one I found online and the one I generated with MTK Droid Tools and Root are 6.0MiB. By truncating it to 500MiB I was able to find the same kernel structure as in the other ones, though I wasn't sure where the ramdisk ended so couldn't reliably check that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I suppose my question is basically: what is wrong with my boot.img?

I mean if the data was being created somewhere in a temp file until its done, It could be recovered but as this is android i dont have idea.\nThe video was important so I'll try anything.\nNOTE: checking in windows, it shows the modification date in the folder DCIM\\Camera, corresponding to the moment i was recording. So at least there was access to that specific folder.</p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n","viewcount":143,"dups":[],"title":"Do I have any chance to recover this video?","tags":["video","data-recovery","delete"],"userid":"15549","related":["15869"],"score":2,"answers":["47682","47693"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-06-21T02:07:25.927","favoritecount":0,"comments":["64215"]},"48908":{"body":"<p>How can I get an old version of the YouTube application for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2?

I tried it on an sms to see if it would work. It didn't but from then on the sms app started two threads, in a seemingly random way: most of the received sms are listed under a number starting with *131*001 that I cannot reply to. In the process all the past sms conversations were \"captured\" and listed under that number. To send sms I had to start a new thread with the same number but without *131*001.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I tried: first, I added *131*001etc as an additional number for my contact, hoping that the threads would be merged. But it did nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, after reading some, I used SMSBackupAndRestore to save the sms and modify the resulting xml file. I noticed one difference between the sms in the two different threads, namely, a difference in the service_center, for instance service_center=\"+852161645501\" for the sms listed as *131*001etc and service_center=\"null\" for the properly listed sms. So I replaced every instance of service_center=\"+852161645501\" (numbers varied) with service_center=\"null\". I then reloaded the modified xml file using SMSBackupAndRestore.</p>\n\n<p>Before the \"fix\" just described, I had about 2,000 messages listed under *131*001etc and about 5 or 6 listed under the correct number. After the \"fix\", I had two more or less evenly split lists, of about 1,000 messages each. Plus a third list got created with 2 messages in it.</p>\n\n<p>As I was doing this, it occurred to me that SMSBackupAndRestore only saves the text of the sms, not the pictures and other attachments. Yet, the pictures and attachments were showing up after applying the \"fix\", showing that the sms had not really been deleted, merely taken off the directory and upon being re-loaded the android sms app would \"recognize\" the messages and re-load the pictures and attachments. This means that there is a folder somewhere with the history of my sms. And the android sms app is using information stored there to recreate the *131*001etc thread that I'm trying to delete.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to delete all the cache. I couldn't find it by browsing (I'm using Windows 7), so I downloaded some apps to help me, two apps named 1tap cleaner, both worked in a similar way and deleted cache, but obviously not the cache I want to delete since it hasn't solved anything.</p>\n\n<p>I have deleted all the sms, but double threads listed as *131*001etc still happen with the new messages. Plus now I can't even add a picture to my contacts (when I \"edit\" the contact, I can only edit the name and number, nothing else)...</p>\n\n<p>Handcent hasn't helped.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on how to get out of this nightmare? many thanks.</p>\n","viewcount":702,"dups":[],"title":"stock sms client creates multiple threads for the same number","tags":["samsung-galaxy-s","2.3-gingerbread","sms"],"userid":"12393","related":[],"score":2,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-02-09T20:55:15.363","favoritecount":0,"comments":["22357","22398"]},"60518":{"body":"<p>How do i transfer files from my android smartphone to windows laptop ?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE : Bluetooth is working fine on both the devices and is in ON mode. </p>\n","viewcount":13716,"dups":[],"title":"How do i transfer files from my android smartphone to windows laptop?","tags":["file-transfer"],"userid":"48750","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["60540","60541","60531","60519"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-01-06T04:50:43.010","favoritecount":0,"comments":["81932"]},"60513":{"body":"<p>I need to use a wired microphone to run a ham radio application that allows sound to go into the note 3 and sound out as well.

The problem is that if I need one hand to hold the phone (in order to read what I type) and one to hold the keyboard in most of the scenarios above, I am left with at best a few fingers to type on the keyboard, which would hardly be better than using the touch screen.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I am thinking about a keyboard with a holder, which would need to be really tall in order to be close enough for me to actually read what I type. I imagine that the time it takes to set up something like this, would mean that it would not pay off for just typing the 300 characters.</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion so far, is therefore, that there is no current solution to this problem, which would make me faster, apart from buying an android phone with a built in keyboard. Are there any alternatives I have missed?</p>\n","viewcount":223,"dups":[],"title":"What kind of hardware can be used to speed up the writing on android phones?","tags":["keyboard","hardware"],"userid":"2632","related":[],"score":2,"answers":["10044","10021","58598"],"acceptedanswer":"10044","creationdate":"2011-06-03T10:01:08.393","favoritecount":0,"comments":["12132"]},"14588":{"body":"<p>In Google Maps Android 5.10 you can save a place by clicking and starring the place.

So\n  making the appropriate ioctl(2) calls into the kernel was the best\n  choice.

The actual encryption used for the filesystem for\n  first release is 128 AES with CBC and ESSIV:SHA256. The master key is\n  encrypted with 128 bit AES via calls to the openssl library.</p>\n  \n  <p>Once it was decided to put the smarts in vold, it became obvious that\n  invoking the encryption features would be done like invoking other\n  vold commands, by adding a new module to vold (called cryptfs) and\n  teaching it various commands. The commands are checkpw, restart,\n  enablecrypto, changepw and cryptocomplete. They will be described in\n  more detail below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Android does not an existing tool due to licensing issues...

It turned out to be a branch of <a href=\"http://www.mobileshop.eu\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobileshop.eu</a>, which was also unheard of by me or anyone I know. I'm saying this because I cannot be sure whether the OS itself was bought infected or with a backdoor or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>After several weeks of using, I've noticed rapid battery drain overnight, from 70% to emptying(the phone was turned off when I woke up). Not sure whether it's important, but sometimes, when I turned it on again, I got report that battery is on 252% or similar numbers - I assumed wrong calibration. The weird part is, when my phone 'survived' the night (happened a few times), and I tried to use it in the morning, it felt like I was fighting with someone to control the phone, like someone was tapping on my screen - except no one was near me. I solved that problem once by turning it off (took me a couple of minutes, the other <em>one</em> was fast), and when I figured out I could just remove the battery I used that 'technique' (duh, mornings). Then I'd just turn it back on and it'd be normal, for the rest of the day. After a few days I've started turning off wi-fi&amp;sync (mobile data was always off), and my battery only have lost a couple of percent. When I turn them back on in the morning, it's normal.</p>\n\n<p>The thing that persisted is the silencing of the phone and/or putting it on vibration. I'm sure that didn't press the button accidentally or something, that can happen even when the phone is just sitting on the desk. From what I've noticed, the screen doesn't turn on, but I hear the vibration. Cannot tell whether that happens overnight, since my phone is usually on vibration/silenced during that period of the day. I've checked the app permissions, didn't notice anything weird (if you could instruct me for what to look, I'd be grateful). Only non-play app I've installed is the Youtube Downloader from github.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone have any idea what I'm dealing with? I'm quite new smartphone and Android user, but I know my way around desktop PCs/Linux/Java/some C and experimenting with them, so any help is welcome. If it is a virus, what is the best way to remove it? From what I've read, the Android antiviruses aren't really effective (and if there are any that could help me, please list them), and custom ROMs should erase everything (I'm ready to take that step if needed), but are there any more options? Rooting the phone and uninstalling everything?

I also explored in that question what options were available to sync only to local computers, and to <em>definitively</em> prevent the device from syncing private data (calendar, contacts, todos) to Google. I plan to do my own backups locally.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: not syncing private data with Google is a little trickier than a new user would expect. This is because a Google account is required to use the marketplace, and once the phone has that account, it cannot be removed without a factory reset (at least in version 2.2). The sync to it <em>can</em> be disabled, but if one accidentally turns it on - easily done momentarily, in my view - contacts and calendar are likely to whoosh to the cloud in short order.</p>\n\n<p>One of course has to balance security requirements with usability, and my favourite calendars thus far (Business Calendar, aCalendar) do not offer their own private calendar repositories (they just work with any calendar sync provider). Ergo, they are equally at risk of accidental cloud synching as the stock Calendar application.</p>\n\n<p>So, I am wondering if rooting the device and installing a firewall would be the way to go? I was originally of the view that I could grant application permissions to Market/Play to contact Google, but not Calendar.

Any root owners here have thoughts as to whether it is possible? I'm hoping I can filter+block on <code>calendar.google.com</code> etc whilst permitting <code>play.google.com</code> - or similar.</p>\n\n<p>(I suppose the easiest answer to this Q is \"try it!\", but I'm looking for expertise before I risk rooting my phone).</p>\n","viewcount":2885,"dups":[],"title":"Can Google services be firewall-filtered (market yes, sync no)?","tags":["sync","root","firewall","google-play-services"],"userid":"15844","related":["8260","24041","8598"],"score":0,"answers":["24730"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-06-24T13:58:18.483","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"50653":{"body":"<p>Device: Samsung Galaxy S3</p>\n\n<p>A person I followed had a cool video they posted on Instagram, but then deleted it later.
