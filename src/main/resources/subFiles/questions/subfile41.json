This has happened on both my current ROM (Miui) and every version of Cyanogenmod I've tried.</p>\n\n<p>Usually this problem crops up again a few months after a fresh ROM install or factory reset. I'll switch from 3G to Wifi, or vise versa, and then everything on my phone that uses background data will start force closing. The most usual suspects are Google Services Framework (com.google.process.gapps) and Facebook (com.facebook.katana), but almost any app seems to force close including ScoreCenter, Docs, and Smooth Calendar.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the force closes, the other big symptom is that I can't turn off or on airplane mode, mobile network data (3G), wifi, or background data syncing - but usually not all at the same time. Sometimes I'll be able to turn on Wifi but not airplane mode, or other times I'll be able to turn 3G off but Wifi won't turn off. Sometimes I'll be able to turn a service off or on after a reboot, other times not. Sometimes when I reboot a service that I turned off before will be back on again, other times not. Incredibly, utterly frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Neither rebooting, fixing permissions, nor wiping dalvik cache seem to help. I've only ever gotten my phone to work again by fiddling around with the radio settings and pulling the battery for hours before something magically starts working again.

I was facing this touch problem. For example, if i touch and hold letter 'e' on my keyboard to enter number 3, it will type bunch of letter e's (eeeeee). First I thought it was some software problem(touch driver). But today I found out that if I remove the back cover and use the phone, problem goes away. Weird right?.

The notes were saved using the ActiveNotes application, which is not available on Android, only on Symbian. ActiveNotes saves the notes as HTML files, which I can easily view on Android using the HTML viewer or web browser, or any other html reader (such as Dolphin).</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to use the built-in copy/paste functionality by touch-and-hold then \"select all\" and copy. This does not seem to work in HTML viewer, but does work in the browser or Dolphin. However, ActiveNotes stores the newlines in my notes using paragraph tags (HTML &lt;p&gt; tags) and these are not correctly copied by the built-in text copier. Because of this, all the text appears as one long string, without any line breaks, when I paste it into my Android notes application (or indeed any Android notes application such as Messaging). This is very annoying as many of my notes are in excess of 100 lines long.</p>\n\n<p>A number of copy/paste apps seem to be available which use the \"Share Page\" option on the menu. I use this when accessing my page through a URL through Astro, so the URL looks something like \"content://com.metago.astro.filesystem/mnt/sdcard/Activenotes/NoteNameHere.html?text/plain\". The two copy/paste apps I tried were \"Any Web Copy\" and \"Copy To Clipboard\". The latter seems to always copy just the URL (rather than the page content) to the clipboard. The former copies the web page text to the clipboard for \"http://\" links but refuses to for these \"content://\" links. Even when the web page text is copied to the clipboard (e.g. from an internet page), it still seems to be devoid of any newlines for much of the page.</p>\n\n<p>Since the source of these files is actually viewable (e.g. in the plain text editor) there MUST be a way to copy the content of the pages including newlines. I could do this conversion myself on PC manually for every single file, but this would take a very long time and I would much rather be able to convert files on-demand on my phone using the above method. However, I am at a bit of a loss as to how to preserve the newlines.
