Some of them will let you record using your bluetooth headset instead of the built-in mic.   However, all the ones I have looked at say things like \"tap the button to start recording\".  This defeats the purpose of what I am trying to do, which is to record thoughts I have while I am out and about walking, biking, driving, etc. when I can reach up and hit a button on my bluetooth phone, but I am not able to stop, pull my phone out of wherever I have it stashed, take off my gloves so I can touch the screen, power up the device, enter my lock code, jump to the record app if needed, and tap to start recording.  By the time I have done that I have lost my train of thought, and wasted a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p>Voice activated recording is probably not going to work, because, even though my headset has some degree of wind cancellation, there is a lot of ambient noise from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>I can use voice commands, which is still a bit of a pain but at least keeps me mostly hands free, that is, I can tap the button on my headset, say \"activate\" and my headset will connect to the phone and bring up voice commands.  However, I am not sure what I would do next.  The commands offered are things like \"Go To &lt;&lt; Shortcut >>\", and \"Check &lt;&lt; Item >>\" - these are the only two that seems remotely related to what I am trying to do.  I assume that maybe if I said something like \"Go To Voice Recorder\" it might open up the voice recorder, but I couldn't get it to work and am not sure what it expects for &lt;&lt; Shortcut >>.  Even then, assuming that part would work, I would need to have some way of telling the app to start recording, for instance, if the shortcut was not just the app but a full-blown intent.  I am not sure how I would set that up.  There is also the question of how to stop it, but hopefully hitting the headset button again would work as that already as a similar function while on a phone call.</p>\n\n<p>Am I on the right track here?  Is there some kind of app that will help me out here?  One thing I don't understand is, does the app have to explicitly support bluetooth audio for this to work?

It actually appears to be a hardware issue.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the actual issue. When held portrait with the home/options/back buttons at the bottom, about an inch or so up from those buttons there is a \"dead\" strip that runs horizontally across the entire touch screen. Of course, the keyboard pops up under this strip.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I mean by dead? Well, sometimes choosing an option/box/item that's in this zone, flat out isn't being registered. When typing, it actually causes the touch detection to go haywire. When I tap a key, it usually registers me tapping that key AND one or two of the surrounding keys. Sometimes it doesn't register the intended key just the surround keys.</p>\n\n<p>So, pressing i might return i, might return ui, might return iu, might return u. This behavior happens with most of the keyboard and is incredibly frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>On very rare occasions when I press a letter, it also registers me pressing a key on the completely otherside of the keyboard. The worst example of this is when i hit backspace and it's also registering 'c' and/or 'v' with the click.</p>\n\n<p>As to further demonstrate the issue, I downloaded a drawing app (Draw! if any one's curious) and drew a bunch of lines. It works perfectly when drawing straight lines (well, I'm human so they aren't PERFECTLY straight) up and down, and left and right on the screen.. except when I get to the deadzone. When I'm drawing down (perpendicular) through the dead zone, it works fine with no abnormalities.</p>\n\n<p>But when I draw in a parallel (left to right) direction, when i'm inside the zone it basically draws my straight line has harsh zig-zag lines (ever seen a heart rate monitor?). Additionally some spots in the zone won't be drawn on at all.</p>\n\n<p>Another note to further show that it's a consistent hardware issue: this zone stays in the same place, no matter if I'm holding it portrait or landscape. I'm forced to type on my phone with it being held upside down so the deadzone doesn't go through my keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>I know (well, pretty certain) this is a hardware issue and there's probably no real solution for this phone. But is there any documentation, known issues, reasoning behind this issue? It just started recently and I've had this phone (it's a 'like-new' replacement) for just over a year now. </p>\n\n<p>Should I just bite the bullet and pay for the upgrade to Droid 3 next week?</p>\n","viewcount":1532,"dups":[],"title":"Semi-Dead Zone on Touch Screen On Droid 1","tags":["motorola-droid","touchscreen"],"userid":"5275","related":[],"score":2,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-07-08T16:21:31.497","favoritecount":0,"comments":["13535","13538","13556","24436"]},"47285":{"body":"<p>For the past few days my Nexus 7 wouldn't turn on.

Although it is rooted and I can apply a custom ROM to it, I have not done so yet for several reasons I won't get into but my issue should be independent of that. This phone is by far (in my humble opinion) one of the best and most stable piece of hardware that HTC has produced to date and I couldn't be happier with the phone, hence why I have not upgraded to a newer device. I know the older OS is a turn off to many and I agree that I wish I was running a higher version but most of them don't honor the latest drivers available which means you lose 4G functionality among other things. So I have stuck with it for now until such time as an updated drivers are released (doubtful but one can hope).</p>\n\n<p>I have an 8 GB SD card (7.39 GB usable) and 4.05 GB free - since I move anything that has the option to run off the SD card to external storage. I have 500 MB internal storage (427 MB usable) and a little over 60 MB free. I have never had issues updating anything since the space present has always been enough to install or update before moving stuff to free more space.</p>\n\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n\n<p>Recently when updating apps it often gives me the <code>insufficient storage available</code> message – but it makes no sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Storage facts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>external SD with 8 GB (4 GB free)</li>\n<li>internal storage with 500 MB (60 MB free)</li>\n<li>example problematic app: apk size ~6 MB / installed size 11.46 MB</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Detailed problem (again: TL;DR)</h3>\n\n<p>Specifically the app that is giving the problem recently is Lookout Security &amp; Antivirus which has never been an issue and is only 6 MB and change but it will download it and when attempting to install pops that error. I don't get how a 6 MB file that has never had issue updating on less than 40 MB space is now giving me problems with over 60 MB free? The baffling part is that occasionally it WILL actually update just fine without issue and I have checked my cache and stuff, nothing there, no other apps running that would hog space or anything, so what's wrong? How can I mitigate this? Another bizarre thing that started to happen is that internal apps like Facebook which are bloated on there whether I like it or not and I use rarely are giving me problems too by issuing the invalid page file error. I mean what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what's going on here? What is wrong or what can I do to make it right</strong> so it stops being stupid like this? As I said, NEVER had a single issue with this phone, EVER, but in the past month it has driven me absolutely NUTS. I have even uninstalled applications that don't provide the move to SD option to free up nominal space and it stabilizes for like 2 days and then bam, back to square one even though it has more space now. I am at my wits end and I would appreciate the help; especially not being a novice this is even more mind boggling to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 10/26/13 @7:45 AM</strong>\nThe application updated normally without giving the error and it did so while the internal storage had only 43 MB (as opposed to the 60 MB when it failed numerously). This lends itself to even more confusion as to what is going on. The ONLY thing that was done in the meantime was that I rebooted the phone (actually more like I was low on power, shut it down and when I connected it to the charger, turned it on)</p>\n","viewcount":629,"dups":[],"title":"Insufficient Storage Available During Update","tags":["2.3-gingerbread","insufficient-memory","application-autoupdate"],"userid":"40214","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-10-25T21:56:24.037","favoritecount":0,"comments":["74716","74717","74718","74744","74748","74769","74773","74799","75213","75251","75301","75305"]},"54038":{"body":"<p>I have an HTC One X from T-Mobile Android version 4.0.3 and I would like to run an outboard DAC off the Micro USB port.

I have noticed in the past that updating each app one by one has allowed me to perform all of the updates without a problem.</p>\n\n<p>My intuition is that updates are probably being downloaded to internal storage, so in the case that many updates are being performed at once, the internal storage fills up with a mixture of applied updates, and in-progress downloads.</p>\n\n<p>Performing the app updates one by one allows each app to in turn be downloaded, applied, and then the download removed, before moving on to the next update. If the app is stored on the SD card, doing it this way should mean there is as much room left on the internal storage as before the previous update was applied, so the next can proceed and hopefully succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Given that there doesn't seem to be a way to queue apps for updates (according to the answer to the above linked question), are there any other ways to avoid this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Checking for updates more frequently in order to have smaller simultaneous batches is all I can really come up with for now.</p>\n","viewcount":208,"dups":[],"title":"Is there a way to avoid disk space errors when batch updating apps (using 'Update All')?","tags":["applications","update","internal-storage"],"userid":"4769","related":["8659"],"score":8,"answers":["12060","12061"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-04-30T15:28:42.440","favoritecount":1,"comments":["10546","10547","10549","10552"]},"8780":{"body":"<p>I need to get detailed request data times on Samsung Galaxy Tab on Verison network.
