I'm Hungarian and our alphabet contains special letters like 'á', 'ő', 'ú' and so on. As you can see each basic letter has a single or a double accent on the top of it (or a dot). If that accent leans to the right like this: 'á' then only 70 letters are allowed to send in a single SMS message.

Any help will be much appreciated. </p>\n","viewcount":1500,"dups":[],"title":"Unable to debug in LG Optimis L7","tags":["debug","lg-optimus-l7-2"],"userid":"48768","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["59330"],"acceptedanswer":"59330","creationdate":"2013-12-19T09:57:05.127","favoritecount":0,"comments":["80517","80519","80520","80529","80540","80545"]},"59300":{"body":"<p>When i install apps ,that i take from my friends , it seems quite fishy , so how to check that the apps are trusted or not.</p>\n","viewcount":31,"dups":[],"title":"How i can protect my android from Master Key Vulneralability?","tags":["security"],"userid":"48757","related":["58579"],"score":0,"answers":["59302"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-12-19T08:02:51.267","favoritecount":0,"comments":["95298"]},"59303":{"body":"<p>I just took delivery of a <a href=\"http://thermodo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermodo</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robocat/thermodo-the-tiny-thermometer-for-mobile-devices\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kickstarter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Their website states that a Thermodo app is coming soon for Android but their <a href=\"http://store.thermodo.com/pages/what-is-thermodo\" rel=\"nofollow\">What Is</a> page says it should work with their existing app, <a href=\"http://thermo.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I can't get it to recognise the Thermodo.

I suspected that battery-usage during idle time could be improved. So the next night (7 hours) I put my Nexus into airplane mode, and the next morning the battery had only used 1% for those 7 hours, which proved that there was room for improvement.<br>\nNext I disabled bluetooth and set wi-fi, to be disabled when the screen is locked (changed \"Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep\" from \"Always\" to \"Only when plugged in\").

(The folder is <code>/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0</code> instead of <code>/usr/share/doc/openvpn-2.0/easy-rsa</code>, for instance, and there's a <code>vars</code>, but no <code>init-config</code> script.)

The router server starts now and says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Name  Value\n  Max bcast/mcast queue length  0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>under Status.

Then I went to Settings → Location &amp; security → Install from SD card, and was able to install the CA certificate, added a password, etc.  Trying to add the htc_g2 or server certificates did not work, saying \"no certificate to install\".  I edited the files and removed everything before <code>-----BEGIN</code>, and then they installed.  In \"Add OpenVPN VPN\", I selected the \"ca\" certificate for \"Set CA certificate\", and the htc_g2 certificate for \"Set user certificate\".

I ran Wireshark on the host and the messages from the device are not correct.  The displayed mac addresses do not look right and the protocol is unknown so just displayed as 0x7aab.  After looking at the actual data in the message it appears that there are two zero bytes prepended to the message.  If those were removed it looks like everything would line up and work.  Has anyone ever seen this or know where in the code this can be fixed ?</p>\n\n<p>YET ANOTHER EDIT!!!</p>\n\n<p>After booting everything up this morning, I did not create the fake ARP entries and ran the pings again.  According to Wireshark there was an ARP message coming from the host and an unknown message coming from the Droid, but they were identical lengths.  After examining the contents of the messages, the Droid was sending what appeared to be a valid ARP message as well but it was shifted by 2 bytes - two extra bytes at the beginning and the last two chopped off.</p>\n","viewcount":1986,"dups":[],"title":"Android USB Gadget Driver","tags":["usb","kernel"],"userid":"13033","related":[],"score":3,"answers":["20609"],"acceptedanswer":"20609","creationdate":"2012-03-12T15:25:56.113","favoritecount":0,"comments":["23821","23822"]},"62711":{"body":"<p>I've got an HTC One that I've rooted and flashed with GPE 4.4.

I haven't given my phone to anyone to do anything with it, I've been the only one to use it and I'm 100% sure I haven't rooted it.</p>\n\n<p>Now my big question is \n<strong>How did it get there?</strong>\nWhat does it do? \nHas anyone else had the same thing happen to them?</p>\n\n<p>I was also just wondering about some more information on superuser, rooting and ways that it could have gotten onto my phone.</p>\n","viewcount":1093,"dups":[],"title":"My new phone came with super user but I didn't root it","tags":["2.3-gingerbread","rooting","hardware","samsung-galaxy-y"],"userid":"17380","related":["236"],"score":3,"answers":["66559","26437"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-07-25T12:11:39.473","favoritecount":0,"comments":["32275","32276","32277","32283","80484"]},"32408":{"body":"<p>I would like to put the numbers of the google calendar reminders as one contact into my\n phone.

When you add a user to a group, his or her username/uid gets added to the list of users in that group, for instance the my audio group entry in <code>/etc/group</code> looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>audio:x:29:pulse,edge-case\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where pulse gets mapped to the uid of the pulseaudio daemon and edge-case gets mapped to my uid (1000), on my Linux box.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, each app that gets installed on Android gets it's own uid and gid and this is the bases of the \"sandboxing\" of apps that occurs on Android as they all run in their own process and can't access data of another process or files owned by another app unless there are declaration in a Manifest file created by app programmers which dictates what info is to be shared to other apps and what not. This is also how apps gain or rather request access to networking services during installation by requesting to be added to the INTERNET group or something like that, don't quote me on the name of the NET net group, it might be more like INET or INET6, either way I know there are several levels of network access that can be granted to an application through this mechanism on Android.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, where is this information stored in Android?</p>\n\n<p>Further more, is it possible to modify? </p>\n\n<p>I would like to integrate a glibc stack with it and the data within it in my <code>/etc/{passwd,group}</code> files, trust me, they exist on my phone, I even have apt installed with a lot of other goodies.</p>\n\n<p>Update:\nHave been doing more searches and \n<a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/8452/how-to-know-app-name-by-uid/8465#8465\">This might be what I am looking for.</a></p>\n\n<p>I will need to dig a bit deeper and make sure it is everything I am looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Update: (5:40 June 27 2014)</p>\n\n<p>Since someone thinks I don't know what I am doing or talking about, let me clarify;</p>\n\n<p>User UIDs on Android are offset with 100000 and App UIDs are offset with 10000 when mapped to the user number _ app number, hence when a ps shows something like u0_a10 which means that User with UID 100000 is running app with UID 10010,</p>\n\n<p>I have pulled UID and user/daemon names from system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h and used those to update my /etc/passwd and /etc/group files (On my Android box), for example my /etc/passwd file (on my Android box) looks like this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>....\nbrainard:x:100002:100002:Professor Brainard,0420,,:/home/brainard\n:/bin/bash\nradio:x:1001:1001::/data/radio:/bin/false\nbluetooth:x:1002:1002::/data/bluetooth:/bin/false\ngraphics:x:1003:1003::/home/graphics:/bin/false\ninput:x:1004:1004::/home/input:/bin/false\ncamera:x:1006:1006::/home/camera:/bin/false\nlog:x:1007:1007::/home/log:/bin/false\ncompass:x:1008:1008::/home/compass:/bin/false\nmount:x:1009:1009::/home/mount:/bin/false\nwifi:x:1010:1010::/home/wifi:/bin/false\nadb:x:1011:1011::/home/adb:/bin/false\ninstall:x:1012:1012::/home/install:/bin/false\nmedia:x:1013:1013::/home/media:/bin/false\ndhcp:x:1014:1014::/home/dhcp:/bin/false\n....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have set up configuration in /etc/adduser.conf to create new users like so ( On my Android box) :</p>\n\n<pre><code># FIRST_[GU]ID to LAST_[GU]ID inclusive is the range of UIDs of dynamically\n# allocated user accounts/groups.\nFIRST_UID=100001\nLAST_UID=199999\n\nFIRST_GID=100001\nLAST_GID=199999\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is in accordance with Android's policy, I let \"glibc based\" system users still be created from range 100-999 I believe and I modified the audio user on my /etc/passwd and /etc/group files to be of 1005, like it is on Android.</p>\n\n<p>I need to update Android and synchronize it with info regarding my User UIDs as well as with my Daemon or system user UIDs from the glibc stack.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about this in the book \"Embedded Android\" by Karim Yaghmour\n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1449308295\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sold here</a></p>\n\n<p>My goal is to get programs like nvlc to work but I need to get UIDs and GIDs synchronized so that Android is aware of my users and the groups they belong to so that for instance, my brainard user with have access to the audio devices.</p>\n\n<p>Also I need to inform Android about Postres and it's membership in the network group so that it can open sockets and allow access to databases.

The original post is...</p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>I'm a new user and I'm having a terribly annoying problem with my phone. I have an <strong>LG Marquee</strong> with <em>Boost Mobile</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours ago, I opened up my gallery and the screen froze, then a force-close option popped up (which happens a lot with this phone so I'm used to it &amp; thought it'd just force-close &amp; then go back to normal as usual). Instead, the screen went blank &amp; the blue icons (home, options, back, search) started flashing.</p>\n\n<p>My phone had restarted completely: I had no service, my wallpaper was blank, etc. My phone does this a lot actually, but will just go back to normal. This time it started up normal, but the SD card icon appeared on my notifications bar &amp; it read \"checking SD card for errors\". Typically this would occur but then the \"Media Scanner is Running\" icon would appear &amp; my phone would be fine. The \"media scanner running\" pop up never appeared, and the blue icons just started flashing again as the screen went blank, only to reboot once again.</p>\n\n<p>My phone kept rebooting itself repeatedly for about an hour every minute or two (making it impossible to make a call or send a text!!) Then I finally just turned it off. Every time it'd reboot, it'd last a couple minutes &amp; the \"media scanner running\" pop up would come up, then it'd reboot all over again. Seems as though the media scanner triggers the reboot :/</p>\n\n<p>After reading through many posts on the Internet about this issue, I tried a few things. In attempting to fix the problem, I realized that this issue has nothing to do with my phone itself or the battery - it's the SD card. I haven't dropped my phone at all lately and typically refrain from downloading extra apps that I really don't need. Mostly my SD card is taken up by photos, texts, videos, contacts, &amp; three or four extra apps. The last app I downloaded was last night, it was a photo/gallery organizing app. When the reboots started occurring, I quickly uninstalled the app but it didn't fix the problem. The SD card doesn't look physically damaged at all, &amp; neither does the small port it goes in. I use a 2GB micro SD card, the one that came with the phone when I bought it (not the best choice, I know, I just figured I could make due with it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>I can run my phone perfectly fine</strong> without the impeccably annoying reboots occurring <strong>if I take the SD card out</strong>. The problem is that I obviously need my pictures and videos and other apps, etc. I had quite a few photos and videos, all of which I would be completely devastated and flat out pi**ed off to lose (especially because I had a lot of photos of a close friend that passed away recently in my gallery. Losing those would really make me sooo mad!) All I can do on my phone right now is access the internet, make calls, texts but I have none of my pics/vids &amp; almost none of my apps.</p>\n\n<p>Please help me!! Not only do I want my media and apps back, the constant rebooting is a level of annoying I can't even begin to describe!! I would literally appreciate it so much if someone could help me fix this issue (without having to reformat my SD card and lose everything)': ) and would be forever grateful!! I don't know how you reward/give a thanks to someone that helps you out on here, but I'd happily do it for anyone that can help me fix this problem ASAP. I'm soo unbelievably frustrated, please help me. Thanks so much!</p>\n\n<p>(BTW, my phone is not rooted and none if my photos, videos, or other SD card things are backed up - dumb, I know!! I'm learning my lesson right now, unfortunately)</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE/EDIT:</strong> I have been trying different tricks and tips from others, nothing has solved the problem but I did notice that the media scanner will actually complete scanning and even load my gallery, apps, etc. and show me that the SD card has been mounted but will automatically reboot all over again by itself about 10 seconds later. It's so frustrating that the card is loading and all my stuff is right there in front of me, but then my phone reboots by itself!</p>\n","viewcount":997,"dups":[],"title":"Boot Loop issue","tags":["boot-loop","external-sd"],"userid":"29281","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["40534"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-02-28T17:18:28.127","favoritecount":0,"comments":["54970","54981","54982","54985","55000","55001","55025","55077"]},"44883":{"body":"<p>So I just realised that having a Swipe unlock allows you to have widgets and access to the camera etc. But whenever I put a password, these features are gone.  </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way I can allow for a swipe feature along with widgets etc, but then ask for a password ?? </p>\n\n<p>For example: A password lock app that I can safely use instead of the phone's password lock, then use the phone's swipe to unlock feature and have the password app prompt before action continues ?</p>\n","viewcount":761,"dups":[],"title":"Password unlock and access to widgets?","tags":["lock-screen","4.2-jelly-bean","widgets","password","samsung-galaxy-s-4"],"userid":"18416","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["44891"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-05-03T22:12:32.917","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"40503":{"body":"<p>I tried to install a custom ROM on my htc one X without making any backup.

Then I run the heimdall detect program and find that the device is detected.  Then I run the following to install the custom recovery.  </p>\n\n<p>I obtained the \"recovery.img\" file from a \"recovery.tar\" file that I got from a root kit zip file.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to get around this error?

I have revisited this thread every time I had to install Android SDK. The trick that the author uses is to simply replace the hardware IDs in the INF file to those that actually correspond to the actual hardware device that's being connected.</p>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken I had the same ID as the author describes in the thread, that is <code>USB\\VID_0bb4&amp;Pid_0c94</code>. But now when I check it I have a different one.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0h4zg.png\" alt=\"driver properties\"></p>\n\n<p>I recently flashed the phone. But I used the RUU original image, with the same build number as the one that was already on the phone. The RUU was the HTC original ROM Update Utility that was used to flash it. I had to do this to enable the use of Unrevoked to root and then Alpha Rev to set S-OFF. Could it be that, in some way, this changed the hardware ID? I thought hardware IDs were supposed to be permanent and fixed to the hardware?...</p>\n\n<p>Using the second driver, with unedited INF file, and trying to update the ADB device in Device Manager, this is what it says.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5BDq.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/a0sua.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p>It just simply fails to install it, because the IDs don't match. Now, these are the lines that I used in the edited version of the INF file. These now include the actual IDs of my phone.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Google.NTx86]\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;MI_01\n\n[Google.NTamd64]\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;MI_01\n\n[Strings]\n%SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;REV_0226\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87\n%SingleBootLoaderInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now when I try to update the driver again I get to the warning message, you know the usual Windows warning about installing software of unknown source.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jflBp.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p>So I click to install it anyway.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vAZIp.png\" alt=\"driver update\">\nAnd it tries to install it but then halts and says that installation failed and something about ADB Composite.</p>\n\n<p>So why does it fail to install? And why was my hardware ID changed in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Is there no \"normal\" way of installing this stupid driver? You know, without having to hack the damn thing or play tricks with it?...</p>\n\n<p>I know that some users suggest that one should obtain the latest sync software from the manufacturer because with that also come some USB drivers that are necessary to have. But I don't want any of the HTC bloatware. And I don't have any problems transferring files between the phone and the computer when in \"Disk drive\" mode. So I don't need anything else. And isn't this the driver for using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) which is part of Android SDK? I mean shouldn't Google be the one that provides a working driver then?...</p>\n\n<p>Just for the record, the phone in question is HTC Desire, the original one. You know, the first one, not any of its' many siblings that followed.</p>\n\n<p>Please have a look at this, and let me know what you think this could be. And also let me know if you know of any alternative ways of doing this, just for future use. I am sick and tiered of having to this every single time I want to install the Android SDK. I normally only do that when I need to reinstall Windows, but once installed and set up I usually don't touch it, but I do reinstall Windows at least two times a year.</p>\n","viewcount":5135,"dups":[],"title":"How do I patch the Android ADB driver?","tags":["usb","adb"],"userid":"27231","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["42525"],"acceptedanswer":"42525","creationdate":"2013-03-27T15:15:12.860","favoritecount":0,"comments":["57335","57371","58131"]},"42497":{"body":"<p>I am running 4.5.91 currently on a rooted and unlocked Atrix.</p>\n\n<p>Will I brick my phone by updating to 4.5.141 from OTA source?</p>\n\n<p>Can I re-lock the boot-loader if that is the issue?</p>\n","viewcount":180,"dups":[],"title":"Atrix 4G update via OTA with unlocked bootloader?","tags":["bootloader","ota-update","bootloader-lock","motorola-atrix-4g"],"userid":"19168","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["42999"],"acceptedanswer":"42999","creationdate":"2013-03-27T22:57:25.130","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"42490":{"body":"<p>Generally I get alert when I am in call .

When the system is powered on the <strong>BIOS</strong> initializes and does sanity checks on the computer's hardware and peripherals. The <strong>BIOS</strong> is 'firmware' and exists outside of the computer's normal storage. Even if the system was started with no mass storage, the <strong>BIOS</strong> would still be there. The <strong>BIOS</strong> runs a piece of software in the system's storage called the <strong>bootloader</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bootloader.</strong> The <strong>bootloader</strong> uses and is itself a set of files on the filesystem, sometimes in the /boot directory. The <strong>bootloader</strong> (depending on the case) presents a list of options for how you want to proceed in starting the system.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Each option (usually) corresponds to starting a <strong>kernel</strong> with specific <strong>boot parameters</strong>. The <strong>kernel</strong> is a binary contained in a package file called <strong>vmlinuz</strong> (or similar) that resides somewhere on the filesystem (like the /boot directory). The <strong>kernel</strong> creates abstractions between hardware and software, like the hardware interfaces, filesystem abstraction, processes and threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes <strong>vmlinuz</strong> also contains some utilities that are put into folders like /sbin. Things that are in <strong>vmlinuz</strong> cannot be modified without repackaging a new <strong>vmlinuz</strong> file, and replacing the old one.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>kernel</strong> loads <strong>kernel modules</strong> which do various things and are sometimes drivers. Some <strong>kernel modules</strong> are built into the <strong>kernel</strong>'s binary file and some are separate files on the filesystem, sometimes in the /usr/lib/modules directory.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>kernel</strong> also starts a program called <strong>init</strong> which is in a location that is sometimes specified in the <strong>boot parameters</strong>. <strong>init</strong> mounts mass storage devices to directories and starts a bunch of programs.

I put that in quotes because it was a custom ROM that claimed to be 4.0 but which I suspect was actually Gingerbread+.</li>\n<li>My RAM typically runs at about 85%. But, I doubt this is too useful since Android automatically kills apps when it needs more RAM and the Linux kernel is designed to keep RAM mostly full so as not to waste it.</li>\n<li>Currently, Google Maps is using the most battery, followed by Tasker. I'm quite sure that this isn't typical, however. I can't imagine why Google Maps would be so high, as I don't use it often. Anyway, I turned off the location permissions, so hopefully that'll cure Google Maps. And Tasker doesn't usually consume so much, but when the CPU is pegged it seems to have a harder time operating than most apps. (By the way, I have no location-based profiles in Tasker.)</li>\n<li>Upon rebooting my phone, it's OK until the screen goes off for a period of time. Then, the problems resume. They're so severe that it's often faster to reboot than to try to use the phone without rebooting.</li>\n<li>Auto-rotate seems to have no effect. I regularly toggle it in the normal course of using my phone, and haven't noticed any difference either way.</li>\n<li>Apps would appear to be the culprit since I've experienced the same issue on two different phones and since doing a factory reset. However:\n<ul>\n<li>The process that's consuming the CPU <em>isn't</em> an app but <code>system_server</code>, which is a core part of Android.</li>\n<li>I have a lot of apps, so disabling them one by one would be a time-consuming process.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>I tried re-nicing <code>system_server</code>, but I didn't se any effect.</li>\n</ul>\n","viewcount":20628,"dups":[],"title":"Why is my phone slow?","tags":["samsung-galaxy-nexus","performance"],"userid":"14562","related":[],"score":8,"answers":["32740","39278","36870","32737"],"acceptedanswer":"32737","creationdate":"2012-11-01T06:34:09.077","favoritecount":1,"comments":["42325","42328","56964"]},"35042":{"body":"<p>For those people who are interested in flashing custom roms after rooting their android device:</p>\n\n<p>Does a website exist that provides a definitive, quick &amp; up to date guide to the numerous and varied custom roms that are available for the android platform (obviously not the whole kaboosh, but something that gave a flavour).

I have not installed any new apps that would have caused this, this literally came out of nowhere.  I noticed my phone was getting extremely warm in my pocket, pulled it out and say my battery was almost completely discharged and went in to look at what caused the battery to drain so fast.  Top app on the stock Android battery usage settings was Flixter.  I thought maybe something was wrong with the app, FC'd it and put my phone away.  This morning I took my phone off the charger (100%) put it in my pocket on my way to work and again my pocket got nice and warm.  Pulled it out and saw that I was already at 81% battery after about 40 minutes of driving.  Again I pulled up the battery settings and saw Maps was the number one culprit this time.</p>\n\n<p>If I use an app that needs GPS it works fine, can lock on to location quickly, etc, but I am getting a huge battery drain all the time.

I'm technically-minded but new to this OS. I'd like to find a calendar that runs in limited security permissions, so that my calender isn't synced to anywhere over the internet. I am happy to take responsibility for my own backups.</p>\n\n<p>I have signed up for a Google account to run the stock Calendar app (it mandates it), to access Google Maps and to access the market. I've set the Google account to \"Sync is OFF\" in General Sync Settings, and I've turned off Auto Sync. I've kept Background Data turned on, and turned off Google syncing in the Calendar options. I am hoping this combination of settings means that my calendar will not be copied off the device, though I'm not confident this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn't aware until after purchasing that app-level security permissions could <em>not</em> be modified in Android - some light research just now suggests that one needs to root the device to get that feature. (I may well do that, but I want to get a working set-up first). Since the sandbox permissions for Calendar are <em>do what you want</em>, I've been looking at alternatives. <strong>Jorte Calendar</strong> requires wide permissions, and <strong>Smooth Calendar</strong> looks like it just relies on the standard Calendar app as storage, as I think does <strong>GO Calendar Widget</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm okay with <em>limited</em> data flowing to Google/Microsoft/BigCorp - such as map usage or market searches. But I'd plan to avoid using remote storage for private data: my contacts, texts, calendaring and so forth (there's something about Calendar refusing to start without a Google or FB account that is a touch irksome). I could use a local calendar on my old Sony K660 without wondering if it was being copied without consent - are there calendar apps that will do this? Or is rooting &amp; resetting perms for Calendar my best option?</p>\n\n<p><em>Addendum</em>: in Privacy Settings, I've turned off Back Up My Data. Turning it on then off again reveals this dialogue box message: <em>Are you sure you want to stop backing up your settings and application data and erase all copies on Google servers?</em>. So that's a reassurance that file system data won't get synched by the stock OS - just Contacts and Calendar to go <code>:-)</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Post Addendum</em>: I suggested in the comments that I might use the Corporate feature, in which one can add a Microsoft Exchange account. However this appears sadly to be subject to similar privacy objections that I apply to the Google account requirement. The user is asked for an email and password, and is confronted with this message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By activating this application you accept that part of your mobile phone data (comprising IMEI and model name) will be stored, processed and used by Samsung for the purpose of reporting activation of the application to the licensors of the application software itself. Such data held by Samsung will be dealt with strictly in accordance with Samsung's privacy policy. A copy of the policy is available upon request. Continue?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Admittedly this is a small privacy risk compared to the wholesale copying of a calendar or contacts, but it still emphasises the point that the corporate storage of ones data is essentially mandatory. (Added here for the benefit of search engines on this topic.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, it may still be worth a go. For those of us without access to a real private Exchange server, one would need to find something to emulate one, so that the Google account can be removed.

I need to explain all this to help others and to avoid helpful contributors to provide answer without asking clarifications.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My requirement in one line: \"to enable an Android phone to display Tamil characters properly\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elaboration:</strong>\nTamil, like any other Indian language has complex character rendering system. Unlike English or other Latin based script, it has glyph (what you see in screen) composed of more than one character. \nAndroid does not have ability to render such complex scripts (with exceptions). My aim is to know how I can provide such an ability to an Android phone or tablet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Little background that I gathered so far:</strong>\nTo display a glyph in screen, Android first needs a suitable font file.  Android device has a folder <em>/system/fonts</em> which has few of them.  The most interesting file in that folder is the DroidSansFallback.ttf.  As the name suggests, when Android's system fails to find a character in system fonts (that could be DroidSans.ttf or DroidSans-Bold.ttf etc) it falls back to search it in DroidSansFallback.ttf.</p>\n\n<p>By replacing a suitable font file from PC (Latha.ttf or Lohit-Tamil.ttf - these are fonts for Tamil) and DroidSansFallback.ttf will enable to display Tamil characters in the device.\nIt is not so easy to replace and it involves rooting the device and mounting the system as writable. </p>\n\n<p>In spite of those troubles, even if the DroidSansFallback.ttf is replaced, the Tamil characters that are displayed are not rendered properly.  The Tamil character \"தி\" is a conjunct of two characters and instead of getting displayed as \"தி\", it will be displayed as \"த ி\" without space in between. Though this is enough to read short messages, it cannot be used to read books etc.</p>\n\n<p>From Android 4.0 on wards, Tamil and other few languages are supported through browser as said in Android 4.x API overview as seen below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Support for Indic fonts (Devanagari, Bengali, and Tamil, including the complex\ncharacter support needed for combining glyphs) in WebView and the built-in Browser\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The words to notice is \"in WebView and the built-in Browser\", which means that Tamil characters will be rendered perfectly if it is rendered as HTML content and will not be rendered otherwise.  Opera and other few browsers did this even before Android 4.0 by substituting image instead of character.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that in few devices that target Indian market (ex: LG Optimus One, most of Samsung phones and tablets) are able to display Tamil properly both in browser and even in places out of browser like in contacts, text messages, file names etc.  To my surprise they do this even in Android 2.3 onwards.  I also noticed that the same model targeting non-Indian country running same version of Android does not support Tamil character display.</p>\n\n<p>This made me to investigate further and reached a conclusion that Android (as other Linux based OS) depends on a font rendering engine to display such complex characters.  The two engines that I came across are Skia and Harfbuzz. I noticed LG uses skia and Samsung uses Harfbuzz libraries in their devices to bring this ability.</p>\n\n<p>I came across many websites suggesting to replaces these libraries and fonts. It did not work and results in freezing.  Fortunately I backed up using clockworkmod and hence I restored my phone.</p>\n\n<p>Though I had explained this with Tamil, this is applicable for most of the Indian languages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here comes my question (if you are still reading;) )</strong>\nNow, far sure it is clear that a TTF file should be present to provide characters and an appropriate libraries (libskia.so or libharfbuzz.so) are required to render them correctly.  Does any one know how these manufacturers are able to provide the ability? I am even ready to build my own ROM from AOSP (Android Open Source Project).</p>\n","viewcount":38440,"dups":[],"title":"How to make an Android device to display complex rendering of Indic characters?","tags":["languages","localization","fonts"],"userid":"9556","related":["1184"],"score":30,"answers":["41576","33145","26290","26285"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-07-06T11:10:29.703","favoritecount":14,"comments":["39702","82562"]},"77782":{"body":"<p>I try to download apps like Vine and other apps but, it continuously says insufficient storage and I have an sd card and enough internal storage to download.

This is my first Android phone and my first time trying to do this.  I do come from a programming background, so I didn't anticipate it giving me any trouble.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Droid Razr and I had Gingerbread 2.3.6 on it before I rooted it.  After the root, it started giving me notifications for the 6.1...something update, but since I rooted it, the update wouldn't take.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to put Eclipse ICS ROM on it.  First, I backed up my apps, put Safestrap into safe mode, and created a backup.  I followed the directions <a href=\"http://droidrazrroot.com/droid-razr-hacks/how-to-install-rom-on-rooted-droid-razr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for flashing the ROM.  I waited about 5-10 minutes after rebooting - the Motorola logo came up on my phone, followed by the Safestrap boot options, then nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I rebooted and got into the Safestrap menu and tried to restore my backup ROM.  The restore failed.  I tried formatting the device through Safestrap and it still didn't start up.</p>\n\n<p>I followed the directions <a href=\"http://droidrazrroot.com/droid-razr-unroot/how-to-unrootunbrick-your-rooted-droid-razr-back-to-android-2-3-66-12-173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> up to step 7 to unroot/unbrick.  This uses Droid Razr Utility 1.42, and everything I tried came back with a \"command failed\" message.  I thought it was a little strange that the only option it was giving me was to restore version 6.12.173 while I had 2.3.6, but I figured I would at least try it, and I thought that was why I was getting the \"command failed\" message.  After googling, I downloaded Droid Razr Utility 1.8 and tried restoring it to 6.16.211 (official kernel) - again, the only option it gave me.</p>\n\n<p>After that, I can no longer enter Safestrap.  The phone doesn't boot - it goes through the Motorola logo and then shows a small bar of static right at the bottom of the screen.  Fastboot recovery and restoring the phone to factory settings makes an error show up on the screen (the Android mascot and an exclamation point in a triangle).</p>\n\n<p>I can still enter into Android recovery and I still have access to the contents of my SD card.  I can see the folder where my Safestrap backup should be, but there's nothing in there that the phone recognizes as bootable.  I can still also access the Eclipse.zip file.
