The phone seemed to work okay until ICS and it started to get worse with Jelly bean. Now-a-days the phone is really slow and it is mostly unusable. It becomes more unusable when enabling data/wifi. I assume many apps are sent the broadcast message at the same time and they are all trying to perform updates at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>I used to have Watchdog app and for quite a long time I have been monitoring cpu utilization and load average and found it to be high at most times. Until one day, I spotted the available memory was close to zero. Then i assumed the cpu is performing a lot of wasteful GC at most times. Later, I spotted more occurrences of memory plummeting to zero. I noticed that the garbage collection kicks in when I view 'My apps -> Running' and I am not sure whether it happens often enough to make the system performant. </p>\n\n<p>In order to debug, I decided to reduce the number of apps and started uninstalling many of the apps including watchdog but that approach has not solved the problem. I have installed cyanogen updates and that has not solved the problem. I did notice the phone is much faster with the default apps from cyanogen. after installing gapps.zip, android installs more apps based on purchase history and the phone becomes slower. also the phone seems to be faster on restart and after a few days of uptime, it has less memory to work with. i believe there may be a memory leak and not enough memory to launch new apps and does wasteful GC work.</p>\n\n<p>the ways I realize the phone to be slow are\n1. when looking at running apps, android seem to be killing many non-foreground apps as I notice status 'restarting'\n2. when i use the button on my microphone, the beep to the interrupt arrives either too late or it is completely missed. \n3. if i come out of an app to the home screen, I can notice trebuchet initializing</p>\n\n<p>guys, can you please offer some suggestions to debug the issue?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>Currently installed apps</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'

I have a very peculiar issue with the battery. I've been using the phone for just over one year now. There are some periods (about 7 to 15 days) when battery performance is absolutely fine. </p>\n\n<p>But then after certain days of good performance battery starts behaving weirdly: Phone gets switched off even at over 60% battery. Restarting it shows about 5% battery, again switches off, restart shows around 20% etc. </p>\n\n<p>So I guessed there is some calibration issue. <strong>Taking out the battery at the time of this erratic behavior makes it work fine for a little while</strong> (half an hour to a couple of hours) then again the stupidity starts. I have tried draining the battery to 0% and then a full charge, tried various usage models (not using wifi, disabling animations to reduce usage etc.) nothing seems to work. </p>\n\n<p>I can't properly debug this issue properly as connecting to computer starts charging and when its charging there are no such issues. This is <strong>REALLY</strong> frustrating, Any one has any idea how to debug it? </p>\n\n<p>(I have come to know that certain batch of HTC sensation has this issue, not everyone has experienced similar problems but there are people and no one has been able to point me in the right direction)</p>\n","viewcount":7115,"dups":[],"title":"How to debug a battery issue?","tags":["battery","htc-sensation"],"userid":"18699","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["32122"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-08-30T15:13:31.117","favoritecount":1,"comments":["35620","35632"]},"9213":{"body":"<p>I don't even know why it does this, tbh, since pretty much everyone writes $xx.xx and not anything else, such as xx.xxUS$ or anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Turning off Auto-Punctuate does not fix this problem, so this is my hail mary attempt to get rid of this \"feature.\"  :P</p>\n\n<p>(Edit: My phone is a Motorola Droid 2 Global.

(The data stream should be relatively simple if I understand rightly. Would I need Android drivers for the external USB or Windows drivers for it (if a Windows emulator is to be installed), or both? or is there a smart person who can make a driver for such external devices on a smartphone with Android and make himself 'millions' and avoid Windows altogether, (using perhaps Ubuntu or a stripped down Linux version (- OpenCPN works with Linux)). (Saying that, there will always be companies who make products with drivers for Windows only, so maybe via windows isn't the worst way?). </p>\n\n<p>Boats work on 12v so the optimal solution would be to find a phone/tablet as the 'mother part' in such a system that works on 12v - or - if a voltage converter is to be used, the more efficient it is, the better. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for wanting the device on all the time is for safety at sea - watching for an AIS signal 24 hours a day = a vessel approaching, or so that the 'anchor watch' can be used (= if the vessel moves more than a few metres whilst one is asleep, or the water depth changes, an alarm sounds).</p>\n\n<p>Having researched the issue, it seems no in the whole world has made a system that runs Open CPN that is not laptop based. I haven't even found a tablet based version capable of running the external AIS receiver/GPS as well, which I find almost shocking. But using a phone would mean far less power usage and a cheaper platform, available to all. The ability to then connect an external screen (by the helmsman, for out in the weather, daytime, let's say) would be the creme de la creme.</p>\n\n<p>Got all that?
