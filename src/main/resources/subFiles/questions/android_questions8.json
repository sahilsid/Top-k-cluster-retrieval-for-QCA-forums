It came with the L preview on it, and I decided to flash CM 11 instead. My last phone was a Nexus S, and I've flashed various ROMs to that thing in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Using the same machine that just re-flashed that Nexus S a couple weeks ago, I booted the Nexus 5 into fastboot mode, flashed ClockworkMod onto it and re-unlocked the bootloader. However, when I tried using ADB to push the CyanogenMod image over, I got <code>error: device not found</code>. Sure enough, <code>adb devices</code> fails to detect the device, even though USB debugging is enabled.</p>\n\n<p>I decided this was just an issue with L, so I used Google's <code>flash-all.sh</code> script to give me a stock KitKat install. This worked fine, since it's pushing the image via fastboot. However, I still can't get the device to show up to ADB. When I enable USB debugging with the phone plugged into my computer, I don't get a fingerprint confirmation dialog, and no icon notification appears to indicate that it's connected to a computer. I've tried 2 different OSes (Windows 7 and Linux Mint 14) on 3 different computers with 4 different USB cables.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried installing Google's USB drivers, and I have this problem with both fresh installs of the Android SDK and time-tested ones. I've already got <code>0x18d1</code> in my adb_usb.ini. On my Linux system, the output of the <code>lsusb</code> command gives identical output whether the phone is connected (with USB debugging enabled) or not. When it's in fastboot, it shows up as <code>Bus 001 Device 069: ID 18d1:4ee0 Google Inc.</code></p>\n\n<p>The phone seems to work perfectly fine in every other respect. I'm pretty happy with vanilla KitKat, but I'd be happier at least knowing I had the option to use something else. I also like having access to <code>adb shell</code> now and then.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen plenty of people having issues with ADB before, but never without also having fastboot problems. Any ideas what might be going on? I'd prefer a Linux solution, but I can also work with Windows if needed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update:</em> I was able to get the appropriate files into /sdcard/ by simply downloading them with a web browser, then flashing them with ClockworkMod. I'm now running CM 11, and the ADB problem hasn't gone away. Whatever is causing this, it persists through complete ROM replacements.

I used to do the ordering\nafter-the-fact when hundreds of images would have accumulated, because\ndoing it everytime I read a webcomic for 10 minutes in the bus was\njust not possible – I would stop reading when the bus arrived at the\ntarget, and just not have the time to sort them right away. Sadly this\nturned the fun of reading webcomics into something that would cause\nannoying work later on.</p>\n\n<p>What worked for me on the PC was using a save-as dialogue and renaming\nthe files as I save them. On my iOS device I have bookmarklets that\ntake me to \"Documents by Readdle\" that provides a browser with \"Save\nAs\". Downside: If I am viewing something in e.g. the Feedly in-app\nbrowser, I have first to switch to chrome and then to Documents in\norder to download anything in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact: The out-of-the-box situation is even worse on iOS than on\nAndroid.

After trying some\nalternatives, I have found that there is no combination of desktop\n(Windows), Android and iOS browsers, that implements this\nfunctionality with the required efficiency and reliability other than\nusing Chrome on all devices. </p>\n","viewcount":23,"dups":[],"title":"Download file, rename right away, including","tags":["downloading","chrome-for-android","images","file-management","share-menu"],"userid":"37952","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-09-26T10:31:30.840","favoritecount":0,"comments":["72400","72407","72415","72421"]},"36796":{"body":"<p>I have a Razr M and every time I hit the Google Play Store I get an error that says \"server error\". </p>\n\n<p>I have tried everything. </p>\n\n<p>The account is correct and that account works on all my other devices.

The other issue with the one massive zip file is theres no good way to resume on failed download (most of the zip will be recoverable but its not easily possible to go back and figure out which pictures werent included); and it fails for large files often because the connection timeout is shorter than it takes to transfer 15gb over wifi. Lame.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.phototransfer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Photo Transfer App</a> is great except it does not support delete (I contacted them and they say it is because on iOS apps are not allowed to delete user content; but I put in a feature request for their Android version - hopefully they implement it). Also \"backup\" mode must be used instead of \"download\" for large numbers of files because \"select all\" only selects the current page and the max page size is 400 files. Also all albums must be done separately (the Razr sometimes has 3 albums, two internal areas and the sd card).

Similarily, in remote (FTP) mode, and other FTP servers such as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lutey.FTPServer&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">FTPServer</a>, it's easier to do the moves on the PC side but still involves hunting through <code>/storage</code> folders and such. Plus you have to remember to delete the thumbnails because the Android gallery does not refresh them accurately and provides no way to force a refresh (yet another UX win for Android). Scripts could theoretically be written on the PC side to automate this; <em>ideally</em> I'd avoid complex initial setup as well even though it does potentially reduce the task itself to one step.</li>\n<li>The suggestion below to copy photos then wipe the device...no</li>\n</ul>\n","viewcount":207,"dups":[],"title":"Move photos from Android to PC wirelessly *in one step*","tags":["wi-fi","photos","windows","data-transfer"],"userid":"67015","related":["48157","49306","48157"],"score":2,"answers":["77063","77103","77049","77014","77016","77021","77058"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-07-11T01:26:41.163","favoritecount":1,"comments":["100213","100214","100216","100217","100257","100271","100336","100893"]},"77009":{"body":"<p>I have purchased from China a mobile name HONMI H2. it was fine but, most of the applications were in Chinese.

There are lots of posts on the web that talk about the fact that unlocking your bootloader wipes apps and data - presumably to prevent unauthorized access to that info.  But in order to unlock the bootloader, you need adb access, and with adb access, any unauthorized person could get access to that data even with the bootloader locked.\n So, essentially, if you've enabled usb debugging, there's no security on this info once you plug the device into a computer. If that's true, the security rationale for wiping this data on unlock is a red herring, and seems mostly to be done to scare people away from unlocking, no?</p>\n\n<p>That said, I guess that raises the issue of whether you should leave usb debugging enabled on a dev mode phone. Also, does unlocking the bootloader open up other major security holes? Obviously allowing arbitrary kernels to boot could be a problem, but without entering your password on the lock screen and turning on adb access (or usb mounting), can somebody get access through the bootloader (or a flashed recovery module)?</p>\n\n<p>On my nexus one, usb access required you to okay it from the phone - i.e. you had to at least enter your lockscreen password in order to say okay.  Just got a nexus 4, and usb access is different - you get a choice between MTP or camera mode, but I don't remember being asked whether to grant access at all (don't have it with me to check).  But assuming it wouldn't be granted without the lockscreen password having been entered, I guess that's okay.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves the recovery module.  I guess anybody can get access to that, and a malicious user (even on a locked phone?) could restore the phone to factory settings and wipe all your data.  But could they use a custom recovery module to gain access to the data?  All they can do is flash any roms you've put out there, right? - can that mechanism be used to bypass lockscreen security.

To be precise: I did the <code>Vodafone-test</code> only after upgrading ROM.</p>\n\n<p>The Vodafone Station 2 router features wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n where my plain old home router only supports b/g.

I only need file management when I'm actively using the app. (In case my specific example does turn out to have a need, suppose for the sake of the discussion that it actually doesn't.)</li>\n<li>The fact that it runs in the background is confirmed by a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eolwral.osmonitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">system monitor</a>.</li>\n<li>Even though I believe that it has no legitimate need to run in the background and don't want it to do so, I <em>don't</em> want to uninstall it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can I prevent such an app from running in the background?</p>\n\n<h1>Practical application</h1>\n\n<p>To illustrate the need for this specific question, and why I'm not naming specific apps, consider what I had in mind when I wrote this question:</p>\n\n<p>I would like to go through my apps and decide which ones I want to run as services. Some should run without restrictions. Some should never run. Some should only run when some set of conditions is met. Using the information from an answer to this question, I could implement this--possibly by some custom scripting, possibly using Tasker, or possibly using another approach. Trying to handle this via each individual app's settings would be well-nigh impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if what I'm asking in this question isn't possible, then this application of it isn't viable.</p>\n\n<h1>Notes based on the comments and answers</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The reason why I want to do this is irrelevant. Perhaps it's to save battery. Perhaps it's another reason. This question is about <em>how</em>, not <em>why</em>. A warning that a particular solution could have negative side-effects is useful if presented along with that solution. Saying, \"It's impossible\" is legitimate if true. Saying \"Don't do it\" isn't useful.</li>\n<li>This is not a duplicate of the <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/1349/14562\">question</a> I linked to in my first paragraph. That question was about saving memory. This one isn't. That one said, basically, \"Don't try.\" That's not a valid answer to this question.</li>\n<li>The specific apps are unimportant, which is why I was vague.

Yes, and no. This is very\n  dependent on whom makes your device.\n  For example, my Lenovo laptop will not\n  apply a charge to the battery unless\n  it is under 97%. When it does charge\n  the battery it charges directly to\n  100%, then stops until the battery\n  sags below 97%. Many laptops did not\n  do this, on most just applying charge\n  if it is not 100%. This would put the\n  battery through thousands of charge\n  cycles in a week when you are not\n  using the battery. This ages a battery\n  quickly.</p>\n  \n  <p>If your phone maker took the time and\n  paid the extra cash then your phone\n  will stop charging once it reaches\n  full charge and just power the system\n  from the wall outlet. It is\n  significantly more likely that your\n  phone is charging your battery on a\n  short cycle and aging it thoroughly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answerer mentions that it depends on manufacturer.

There is not a single reference to \"CDC Serial\". I'm not an expert, but I do understand some of this. The \"USB Composite Device\" is installed so that Windows can communicate with the phone over the USB cable. The \"Galaxy S4 (sg)\" is the name I gave to my phone during setup, and this is the device that presents itself to Windows as a media player, makes use of the MTP protocol, and this is what shows up in Windows Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>How am I supposed to know what \"CDC Serial\" is if it's not described in the user's manual? I have never seen that before on any Android device when connected to a PC. I did a search for \"cdc serial\" on Google and all I could find was people doing some hacks to their phones, like rooting, changing ROM, and generally just hacking it.</p>\n\n<p>So what if I don't want to do any of that? Is it still important to configure the \"CDC Serial\" device?

They said they would look into it, but that's it. No help at all.</p>\n\n<p>The user's manual says I can change the USB connection type from MTP to PTP. It essentially makes the phone present itself to Windows as a still camera device. I tried that there were no issues with drivers not being installed.

Examples of such launchers are <a href=\"http://qsapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a>, <a href=\"http://www.launchy.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Launchy</a>, <a href=\"http://do.cooperteam.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gnome-Do</a> and <a href=\"http://engla.github.com/kupfer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kupfer</a> (which I currently prefer). The power of these launchers is that you can easily open them with a shortcut, type a few characters to find the application and press enter to launch it.<br>\nI'm looking for a similar app for Android (I'm using a Nexus 7 with 4.2). I already found a few solutions, but they all have small shortcomings, so I'm still looking for the perfect solution:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vu.de.urpool.quickdroid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quickdroid</a>: This Open Source app can search apps, contacts, music and a few other things. It also provides a 'quick launch' by adding a permanent notification to open Quickdroid. However it still feels as not fast enough, as you have to open the notification drawer, search for the quickdroid notification and touch it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ligi.fast\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAST App Search</a>: This is a much simpler app (also Open Source), which only searches apps (no contacts etc, so that's it's weak point). It can however be configured to launch when dragging the home button from the bottom up to the center of the screen, thereby replacing Google Now.</li>\n<li>Google Now: When dragging the home button up, the Nexus 7 will by default launch Google Now. This actually searches for apps, music, contacts etc and applications can add 'catalogs' to it. So in fact this is pretty much what I'm looking for. The problem here is that (1) After opening Google Now you need to tap the search field before you can start typing, (2) because of the google search suggestions, the actual matching applications are hidden behind the onscreen keyboard and (3) to really search all the 'catalogs' you need to tap 'search tablet'.</li>\n<li>Google from homescreen: I can also press the google search button on the homescreen of the Nexus 7. The result is similar to opening Google Now, except that the search field immediately gets the cursor-focus. This obviously adds another step because you have to make the homescreen visible, and doesn't solve the search suggestions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is it possible to configure the 'drag the home button up'-action, to launch the google search, with the search field focused and immediately in tablet-search modus? This certainly feels like the best solution as it is already part of Android and apps can extend it by adding content.<br>\nOr are there other similar apps that can be configured to launch by a single tap/drag and search for apps, contacts, music, etc?</p>\n","viewcount":1634,"dups":[],"title":"Looking for a launcher similar to Launchy, Synapse or Kupfer (with type to find and launch app feature)","tags":["launcher","search"],"userid":"29155","related":[],"score":3,"answers":["41018","41016","40976","67914","40955","41064","62911"],"acceptedanswer":"41064","creationdate":"2013-02-26T22:02:22.163","favoritecount":0,"comments":["54760","54816","54819","57139","57251"]},"29962":{"body":"<p>The reason for the question is that I have a friend with an iPhone who sends emoticons, and I receive them as a single rectangular box.

Here is my situation:</p>\n\n<p>On my PC (Windows 7), I have Windows Calendar installed: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Calendar</a>\nIt didn't come with it (it actually stopped being released after Vista) so I had to hack around a bit to get it on there.\nI use Windows Calendar partially (20%) for appointments and their reminders. My main use of it, though, is Tasks and their\nreminders. Nearly always, when I have a reminder, I snooze it; I rarely complete my task after the first reminder.\nSo, I usually end up snoozing my reminders minutes/hours/days/weeks into the future. Windows Calendar is perfectly suited\nfor this functionality and is the reason why I chose it and like to use it. The calendar is currently stored on the same PC\nand is not stored remotely somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I got an HTC Desire 601. I would like to access the same appointments and tasks from the phone and, importantly,\nhave the reminders synchronized. To clarify, I would like to be able to snooze a task from my PC at 6pm for 2 hours, leave\nhome for at least 2 hours, and have the task popup on my phone at 8pm with a similar prompt to snooze. So, I'm looking for a fairly\ncomplete synchronization effect between the PC and the phone.</p>\n\n<p>So, to do this, I obviously need a shared service (Google Calendar, etc.) or a shared file (iCalendar, CalDAV) on a server\nthat both my phone and PC can access. One knock against Google Calendar is that tasks are deficient compared to tasks on\nWindows Calendar. Google Calendar tasks don't have reminders (and, therefore, nothing to snooze), so I have ruled Google Calendar out.\nI'm not familiar with other SaaS calendaring/task offerings (Microsoft, etc.)...maybe someone could advise if they handle\ntasks more like Windows Calendar.</p>\n\n<p>On the phone, there is a calendar built into Android which is pretty close to what I want for a native client. Popups for\nreminders, though, have no snooze duration. So, I can't choose how long I want it to snooze. This is fairly significant\nbecause I routinely snooze one task for 5 minutes and snooze another task for 1 week. So, I need a client on my phone\nthat has this type of functionality. Furthermore, I need a client that will connect to the \"shared\" service/file that I\nmentioned earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Am I stretching the limits of the SaaS offerings out there and the available native clients too much that I now need to write\nmy own Android client? I'm not sure about Windows Calendar \"automatic synchronization\", so I'm flexible enough to accept\nchanging to a client like Mozilla Lightning, if necessary. I have tested Mozilla Lightning and it synchronizes (appointments)\nwell with Google Calendar, for example.\nAny advice for my problem?</p>\n","viewcount":155,"dups":[],"title":"sync android calendar (tasks) with calendar from PC","tags":["sync","calendar"],"userid":"39689","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["64339"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-02-25T14:55:59.930","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"52743":{"body":"<p>In my old phone I had a setting called \"Area Info - cell information\".

This app is a \"default app\" and is automatically granted permission to MODIFY BATTERY STATISTICS, (apparently to hide its tracks from the user,) as well as pretty much permission to do whatever it wants, right up to internet access.

So if track 1 was the first song that I play when I get in the car then it' stuck on track 1's info displaying even if I switch tracks or even albums. </p>\n\n<p>That last one is a minor issue, but it's getting very frustrating finding a player that will just WORK with out having all these erroneous issues pop up. I just switched over from using iPhones for 5 years now and love this phone. So much more customization and ability to do what you want with your phone. I wish I would have switched over earlier. This has been the only issue I have so far faced that has really bugged me and cause much heartache. Has anyone had these issues and if so, did you find a solution, or is there another player out there that I am missing that might work with my setup. I've been to numerous Mazda forums, and the developer forums, and alas nothing and no one has had a solution to my problems. I'm hoping I can get some help here. Thanks in advanced for any and all help. </p>\n\n<p>D.</p>\n","viewcount":715,"dups":[],"title":"Music Player over Bluetooth Issues","tags":["bluetooth","4.3-jelly-bean","music-player","samsung"],"userid":"48160","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-12-17T13:10:01.870","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"59155":{"body":"<p>On my mobile phone I have not got SD card.

I'm now thinking about buying a new Android smartphone, if I can be sure that in the end I'll be able to realize this goal with it. So my main question is: <strong>What do I have to look out for in order to get a device with which I can give projector presentations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I apologize that this question is not exactly about a concrete problem I'm faced with right now – I just don't want to purchase a costly device only to find out later that I can't do with it what I want. I therefore did some thinking and research about the <em>possible</em> problems, and ask you for advice on how to avoid a concrete problem to occur in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some issues that occurred to me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In my experience most projector installations in lecture halls still only provide access to a <strong>VGA</strong> connector. I know that VGA as an analog signal requires D-A conversion from a digital signal, but I'm confused about how much effort this takes: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004B65KXQ/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_9?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2SPS3CI7RTX03\">Some</a> converters have the shape of a box which needs an extra power supply, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Adapter-Audio-%C3%9Cbertragung-Konverterkabel-Unterst%C3%BCtzung-digital/dp/B00DP1OOSK/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AEB9F56C3A3O6\">others</a> are very small and don't need extra power. <strong>What is the difference between these different types of devices, and which kind do I need?</strong> Please note that the links are only meant as examples, I'm not asking specifically about these products.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again in my experience, most installed projectors do not yet support Full HD, but still need signals at resolutions like 800x600 or 1024x768. At least <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0085B5KPQ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2XW1R8G26C2W1\">some</a> HDMI-to-VGA converters appear to support <strong>downscaling</strong> from Full HD to VGA resolutions. Since I probably can't control this from the smartphone/tablet: How does it work? Can I trust that the optimal resolution is automatically negotiated between the adapter and the projector? Can I expect a decent-looking result from the downscaling, or will it be all washed out? Practically speaking: <strong>Is there a specifically named feature of such converters that I should look out for when choosing one?</strong> Again, the link is only for reference.</p></li>\n<li><p>Android apps normally have screen output optimized for the fixed, physically small screen built into the device and not the flexibility that is provided by changing the screen resolution or resizing a window on a Desktop OS. Is it a realistic goal to achieve a <strong>good presentation experience</strong> from a mobile device similar to the one from a laptop? E.g. it appears not to be possible to get Adobe Reader for Android into a proper one-page-fullscreen mode. <strong>Is there presentation software that does this better?</strong> I'm mainly thinking of presentations in pdf format.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And maybe there are caveats I'm not even thinking of?</p>\n","viewcount":7515,"dups":[],"title":"How to use an Android phone or tablet to make a projector presentation?","tags":["video-out"],"userid":"46126","related":[],"score":13,"answers":["57158","57343","59245"],"acceptedanswer":"57158","creationdate":"2013-11-02T18:23:09.927","favoritecount":5,"comments":[]},"1834":{"body":"<p>My Android device (on Verizon) will sometimes display 3G in the status area, and sometimes display 1X.

It was clearly GEN1 a while ago, and I have a feint recollection that Mr Pigfish said it's still GEN1 after I installed the official update (though I'm not sure now).

There is an obvious tension here between (1) my freedom, as the device owner, to turn off the shutter sound, and (2) my expectation of privacy, i.e. that others will not take pictures of me in public without my knowledge / consent. This question is NOT about whether (1) trumps (2) -- that is subjective. And yes, I know you can disable the shutter sound if your root your phone. This question is ONLY about where the legal boundary lies in various parts of the world.</p>\n","viewcount":6657,"dups":[],"title":"Jurisdictions where camera shutter sound is mandated by law","tags":["audio","camera"],"userid":"22918","related":["89"],"score":8,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-10-27T03:38:03.250","favoritecount":1,"comments":["42005","42017"]}}
