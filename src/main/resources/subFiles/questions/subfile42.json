In fact, I remember taking a look at a paper demonstrating that even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gutmann algorithm</a> is <em>not</em> effective on flash drives. For example, <a href=\"http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2256804\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> we find evidence that tools such as Eraser or CCleaner will not handle it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>You can't just overwrite a file to securely erase on a flash drive due to internal logical to physical remapping of flash blocks by the\n  controller. When you overwrite a file, the new contents will simply go\n  to the next free flash block. The old block will be erased later by\n  the controller during idle/garbage collection cycles, but only if no\n  other files are using parts of that block. Until that happens, the\n  contents of the old file will still reside in that flash block</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>The only way to securely erase a flash memory drive without a built in secure erase function is to completely overwrite the entire media\n  to full capacity such that there are no more free flash blocks so that\n  every block must be erased and overwritten.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even so, I am still not sure if overwriting the entire drive would do the trick, because I remember something like flash drives have some sort of extra space used to prevent decrease of total space due to damages to specific areas of the memory during its lifetime. And this extra storage would not be normally accessible by these usual tools and procedures.</p>\n\n<p>About internal storage, I am not sure if I trust Nuke My Phone either, specially because I want to erase whole phone, not automatically selected parts of it. I also do not understand well how a simple app would have such permission to wipe all of \"your data\" which I would assume may include not just your documents but settings from other applications, all this without rooting.</p>\n\n<p>I could not find not even an explanation on the hardware architecture of internal storage, which is necessary since every kind of storage device has its own particularities and, if ever possible, their own secure erasing techniques.</p>\n\n<p>So in sum, I would really appreciate documentation <em>proving</em> that physical deletion is indeed possible both for external SD cards, with their flash drive architecture, and internal storage, whatever architecture is used there.

What do I mean by this? The most egregious and obvious example is while typing, occasionally my keyboard will find it pertinent to, without prompting, close about 95% of the way, stall, then open and close in quick succession many times in an unpredictable fashion. This makes typing very difficult as when I go to type, the phone will sometimes make it impossible to access the keyboard. While it does this odd stutter, the normal \"back\" button shows the \"close keyboard\" icon. When tapped, the keyboard will continue its stuttering until it realizes I wanted it to close, when it closes. I've tried reinstalling the keyboard, resetting the phone to factory settings, and different keyboards like swiftkey.</p>\n\n<p>Along with this keyboard malfunction is the unfortunate glitch in the phone itself, where if it feels like it, the phone will mute and unmute so fast that neither me nor the person on the other end can make out what the other is saying.</p>\n\n<p>More recently some of the system sounds, such as notifications, have begun stuttering.

A couple months ago my OS was updated to Android 2.3. Since then I've had a weird problem with my calendar events. </p>\n\n<p>I can view calendar events just fine, and the calendar syncs with my Google Account bi-directionally without issue.</p>\n\n<p>When I create a calendar event, the \"time zone\" option defaults to my current time zone, \"GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time\", just like it did on Android 2.2. However, when I touch the time zone option to select a time zone, there are two time zone entries that match mine. One is \"GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time\", the other is \"GMT -4, Eastern Time\".</p>\n\n<p>The problem happens when I edit an event. Frequently, when I edit a calendar entry, the event jumps 4 hours ahead unless I manually edit it back down. For example, if I create a calendar event and set the starting time to 1:00pm, when I edit the event I've created the edit screen will show a starting time of 5:00pm. It still shows the correct time zone, but it adds the 4 hour GMT difference into the event's starting time. If I save the event without adjusting it back down, the next time I edit it it will say 9:00pm. This happens regardless of whether the event was originally created on the phone, or if it was created on my desktop PC by visiting <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/calendar</a>. It doesn't seem to matter which of the two \"US Eastern Time\" options I select when creating an event on the phone. This problem did not exist before I installed Android 2.3. It doesn't happen with every single event, but I haven't been able to figure out what the common element is between the unaffected events. It does seem that events that are freshly-created are less prone to this problem (possibly the problem starts after the data's been synced a few times?)</p>\n\n<p>If I create a calendar event on my phone, and then edit it on my desktop PC using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/calendar</a>, the PC edit screen behaves normally, and the changes sync back to my phone without issue. Only when editing events on the phone do I experience this problem.</p>\n\n<p>It's very annoying that I have to dial my events back 4 hours every time I make a change to them.

It has Google Market. The market version is 1.713 - which is nowhere near the latest IIRC.

Probably some kind of CyanogenMod interference. Any good way around that, please?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: debugged the situation a little bit. I happen to know that market updating happens out of the main Market process - the Market (com.android.vending) downloads the update, then fires a broadcast intent UPDATE_MARKET to a receiver in another app (com.android.vending.updater), which in turn installs the package. Here's what I got in the LogCat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>02-01 02:34:16.155: W/ActivityManager(121): Permission Denial:\n  broadcasting Intent { act=com.android.vending.UPDATE_MARKET\n  dat=content://downloads/download/31 } from com.android.vending\n  (pid=1762, uid=10006) requires\n  com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET due to receiver\n  com.android.vending.updater/com.android.vending.updater.UpdateMarketReceiver</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it looks as if the Market app lacks a permission to invoke the updater. The manifest file of Vending.apk, however, does have a </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name=\"com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET\" /&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>line. How is it possible for an app to have a <code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code>, but receive a permission denial message?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: the permission com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET is marked as \"signature\" in the MarketUpdater manifest. Meaning only apps signed by the same certificate as MarketUpdater are granted that permission. That could be the reason Market is not granted the permission - could be signed by a different certificate.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: that's exactly the case. The public key is different.
