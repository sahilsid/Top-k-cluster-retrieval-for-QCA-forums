You need an MHL converter, or adapter, or something. On one end of the adapter, all resources say, there is a \"standard micro-USB\" port, and on the other a \"standard HDMI port\". If they are all so standard, what's the fuzz about 5-pins vs. 11-pins? The HDMI port must be standard for all displays to work with it I guess, so it must be something on the (apparently not so standard) micro-USB side in the phone. Looking in my phone, I can only see a 4-pins female micro-USB connector. Or are these 11 pins (I have a Galaxy Note II) buried somewhere deeper inside?</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there is often talk about this \"switch\" that's thrown as soon as an MHL adapter is connected. USB-OTG is disabled and it becomes a display input/output port only (input for the remote control, if available). I guess that means it's not possible to connect it through a USB hub to the phone? I need a bluetooth mouse and keyboard instead of a USB mouse and keyboard if I want to do this? Or is this only applicable for the 5-pins MHL devices, and is the point of the 11-pins one that I can connect my USB hub to the micro-USB port on the adapter?</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, I've also seen USB 2.0 to HDMI converters. They're twice as expensive as MHL, but they have a normal USB connection and output HDMI, so that would fit directly in my USB hub. (MHL would also fit through a microUSB->USB converter, but it seems there is something special about the micro-USB end that I don't get.) The question is whether my phone (a Galaxy Note II) has drivers for that kind of hardware, and whether the hub is fast enough. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if anyone knows this, I'm curious about how this works on the inside. The graphics chip of the phone sends the video-out to its micro-USB port, just like it would with HDMI, or does it have some custom protocol that the MHL adapter then converts to HDMI? What about HDCP, how can you prevent someone from reading the output stream if every TV in the world can decrypt it already?

There is a <a href=\"http://androidsu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">zip file</a> at <a href=\"http://androidsu.com/superuser/\" rel=\"nofollow\">androidsu.com</a> that I think I can flash, but that's the bit I haven't figured out yet.  </p>\n\n<p>Since I've got an unlocked, but otherwise stock phone, I guess I don't have a recovery image, since if I boot into recovery mode, I get a red triangle with an exclaimation point.</p>\n\n<p>What are my options for recovery images?  Is there anything besides ClockworkMod or Amon Ra?  If I go with either one, how do I get it installed?</p>\n\n<p>Or is there a better way to get this done?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I Installed Amon Ra and used it to flash the su zip file.  I removed the apps that I could without breaking anything.  I didn't free up any space I could use at the moment, but I'm happy to have them gone.  </p>\n","viewcount":1745,"dups":[],"title":"Root EVO 4G stock ROM?","tags":["rooting","htc-evo"],"userid":"20851","related":["1184"],"score":1,"answers":["30180"],"acceptedanswer":"30180","creationdate":"2012-09-30T23:25:59.950","favoritecount":0,"comments":["39204","39287"]},"67082":{"body":"<p>I am searching for a terminal command on AVD (Android Virtual Device) which supports attaching to a wireless interface in an AVD.

Around the point where the battery usage started diving, I had added a calendar remainder, sent an email (to a new contact) and browsed facebook (using their app) and twitter (using the web browser).</p>\n\n<p>I've done all of these things many times before. What could have caused the sudden drain, and how can I stop it happening again when I'm not near a charger?

My workplace is in a 3G dead zone, but has 2G thanks to a repeater box someone has installed nearby.</p>\n\n<p>For the past three months, I have left the phone with 'Sync' and 'Packet Data' switched on all the time. When at work inside the 3G dead zone, I sometimes switch on wifi. Before this incident, I've had no problems at all with battery power, despite leaving Sync on all the time.</p>\n\n<p>After posting the original revision of this question, I charged the phone up while it was switched off, went home and only switched it back on when I got home. I had sync and 3G data all night and the battery wasn't rapidly draining.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, the only change I had made was to carry it with me into my workplace and put the phone on my desk. I didn't switch anything on or off, I <strong>only</strong> carried it to my desk. It very quickly started heating up and I noticed that battery was rapidly draining as before.</p>\n\n<p>I began to suspect that the dead zone was causing the problem. To test this hypothesis, I charged the phone up and switched off wifi, sync and packet data. During the day, I switched on wifi and sync in various combinations. (Text continues after picture.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qDvlG.jpg\" alt=\"Battery usage on second day.\"></p>\n\n<p>The kink in the graph is around 20 minutes where wifi and sync were both switched <strong>off</strong>, but packet data was switched on. During those 20 minutes, the phone was heating up and the battery was draining. When I switched packet data off, normal battery use resumed.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: Something in my phone has a bug where the battery starts draining badly while in a 3G dead zone and packet data is switched on.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this only started happening very recently. I've had this phone since January and have left both packet data and sync switched on almost continuously. I've not knowingly had any software updates recenty and the 3G data availablity of my workplace has been consistently very bad for some time.</p>\n\n<p>Does please anyone know of a fix? </p>\n\n<p><sup>(Many thanks to m'colleague <a href=\"http://computerdissection.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duncan Large</a> for taking the pictures and helping test the hypothesis.)</sup></p>\n","viewcount":8706,"dups":[],"title":"What's causing battery drainage by \"Google Services\" while packet data is switched on in a 3G dead zone?","tags":["samsung-galaxy-s-2","battery-life"],"userid":"13309","related":["9453"],"score":13,"answers":["27577","28874","22312","40433"],"acceptedanswer":"22312","creationdate":"2012-04-23T17:10:44.973","favoritecount":0,"comments":["25875","34188","34189"]},"22176":{"body":"<p>I've been trying to figure out if it's possible to disable/enable GO SMS popup notifications via something like Tasker.

I don't have root on either phone, so solutions offered requiring root are not helpful because (as I understand it) gaining root will wipe the data (at least some) I'm trying to back up.</p>\n\n<p>I also found article about creating a GoldCard for a HTC Desire, is this what I need to do? there was no explanation on what a GoldCard was? It also didn't look like a particularly desirable method as It required wiping the memory card first and had no mention of how to restore if things go bad.</p>\n\n<p>My objectives are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Upgrade the SE X10 mini (it's stuck on Android 1.6!) I know there is a 2.1 upgrade for it, but it's not available unless yo have a windows machine??? I only have Ubuntu + Mac. I'm not prepared to buy a windows licence just to upgrade an android phone (seems Odd!)</p></li>\n<li><p>Try out Android 2.3 and 3.0 on the HTC Desire and the X10, understandably this is play, so I want to be able to go back quickly, especially on the X10 (wifes phone) as I will be in no end of trouble if I brick that and don't get it back by the morning :)</p></li>\n<li><p>If successful with the first 2, then I can look at trying out dev releases and testing them (That is after all my day job) and hopefully being able to contribute. To do this I need to be able to load a release test it out and then roll back on the same night so Ideally I need a process that is quite quick or a bunch of shell commands I can script.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone can steer me on the right course....</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Dave.</p>\n","viewcount":3098,"dups":[],"title":"Looking for Android equivalent of Clonezilla / Diskimage / Ghost etc","tags":["backup"],"userid":false,"related":[],"score":6,"answers":["7205","7172"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-03-20T12:15:41.343","favoritecount":1,"comments":["8308","8311","8349","58794"]},"37661":{"body":"<p>I am using HTC One X and I was trying to enable mobile hotspot function, so I could enjoy internet from my PC adhoc wireless network but it says :</p>\n\n<pre><code> There is a temporary network problem that prevents the \n enablement of the Mobile Hotspot function. \n Please retry later.\n</code></pre>\n","viewcount":13050,"dups":[],"title":"Could not enable mobile hotspot function on HTC One X","tags":["wifi-hotspot","htc-one-x","ad-hoc-networks"],"userid":"25278","related":[],"score":2,"answers":["58009","45919","37932","40118"],"acceptedanswer":"40118","creationdate":"2013-01-15T04:41:56.653","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"77754":{"body":"<p>I'm an Android newbie who has a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" Wifi (SM-T210) and would like to retrieve its stock ROM, modify certain files and add some applications to the system partition, and then flash it into any other SM-T210 device.
