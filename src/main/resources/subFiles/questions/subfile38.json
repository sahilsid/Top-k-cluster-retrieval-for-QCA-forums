I only need file management when I'm actively using the app. (In case my specific example does turn out to have a need, suppose for the sake of the discussion that it actually doesn't.)</li>\n<li>The fact that it runs in the background is confirmed by a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eolwral.osmonitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">system monitor</a>.</li>\n<li>Even though I believe that it has no legitimate need to run in the background and don't want it to do so, I <em>don't</em> want to uninstall it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can I prevent such an app from running in the background?</p>\n\n<h1>Practical application</h1>\n\n<p>To illustrate the need for this specific question, and why I'm not naming specific apps, consider what I had in mind when I wrote this question:</p>\n\n<p>I would like to go through my apps and decide which ones I want to run as services. Some should run without restrictions. Some should never run. Some should only run when some set of conditions is met. Using the information from an answer to this question, I could implement this--possibly by some custom scripting, possibly using Tasker, or possibly using another approach. Trying to handle this via each individual app's settings would be well-nigh impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if what I'm asking in this question isn't possible, then this application of it isn't viable.</p>\n\n<h1>Notes based on the comments and answers</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The reason why I want to do this is irrelevant. Perhaps it's to save battery. Perhaps it's another reason. This question is about <em>how</em>, not <em>why</em>. A warning that a particular solution could have negative side-effects is useful if presented along with that solution. Saying, \"It's impossible\" is legitimate if true. Saying \"Don't do it\" isn't useful.</li>\n<li>This is not a duplicate of the <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/1349/14562\">question</a> I linked to in my first paragraph. That question was about saving memory. This one isn't. That one said, basically, \"Don't try.\" That's not a valid answer to this question.</li>\n<li>The specific apps are unimportant, which is why I was vague. I did give a hint as to a specific example I had in mind, but I'm looking for a general answer here.</li>\n<li>A solution must also prevent an app from automatically restarting; otherwise, it isn't much of a solution.</li>\n<li>A number of people have stated that this is a duplicate. Let me try to explain more clearly why it isn't:\n<ol>\n<li>This question is about how to prevent an app from running in the background, which includes stopping it from restarting if killed.</li>\n<li>The answers so far have fallen into a few general categories:\n<ol>\n<li><em>You shouldn't try, because doing so is unnecessary.</em> I'm not disputing this point at this time, but \"You shouldn't try\" is very different from \"You can't.\" Logically, it's addressing a different question, namely \"Should I try to kill apps that I don't want to run?\"</li>\n<li><em>Use method X to kill the app.</em> Unfortunately, when I tried said method, it didn't prevent the app from restarting, just like others predicted.

Yes, and no. This is very\n  dependent on whom makes your device.\n  For example, my Lenovo laptop will not\n  apply a charge to the battery unless\n  it is under 97%. When it does charge\n  the battery it charges directly to\n  100%, then stops until the battery\n  sags below 97%. Many laptops did not\n  do this, on most just applying charge\n  if it is not 100%. This would put the\n  battery through thousands of charge\n  cycles in a week when you are not\n  using the battery. This ages a battery\n  quickly.</p>\n  \n  <p>If your phone maker took the time and\n  paid the extra cash then your phone\n  will stop charging once it reaches\n  full charge and just power the system\n  from the wall outlet. It is\n  significantly more likely that your\n  phone is charging your battery on a\n  short cycle and aging it thoroughly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answerer mentions that it depends on manufacturer.
