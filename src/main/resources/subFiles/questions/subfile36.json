It came with the L preview on it, and I decided to flash CM 11 instead. My last phone was a Nexus S, and I've flashed various ROMs to that thing in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Using the same machine that just re-flashed that Nexus S a couple weeks ago, I booted the Nexus 5 into fastboot mode, flashed ClockworkMod onto it and re-unlocked the bootloader. However, when I tried using ADB to push the CyanogenMod image over, I got <code>error: device not found</code>. Sure enough, <code>adb devices</code> fails to detect the device, even though USB debugging is enabled.</p>\n\n<p>I decided this was just an issue with L, so I used Google's <code>flash-all.sh</code> script to give me a stock KitKat install. This worked fine, since it's pushing the image via fastboot. However, I still can't get the device to show up to ADB. When I enable USB debugging with the phone plugged into my computer, I don't get a fingerprint confirmation dialog, and no icon notification appears to indicate that it's connected to a computer. I've tried 2 different OSes (Windows 7 and Linux Mint 14) on 3 different computers with 4 different USB cables.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried installing Google's USB drivers, and I have this problem with both fresh installs of the Android SDK and time-tested ones. I've already got <code>0x18d1</code> in my adb_usb.ini. On my Linux system, the output of the <code>lsusb</code> command gives identical output whether the phone is connected (with USB debugging enabled) or not. When it's in fastboot, it shows up as <code>Bus 001 Device 069: ID 18d1:4ee0 Google Inc.</code></p>\n\n<p>The phone seems to work perfectly fine in every other respect. I'm pretty happy with vanilla KitKat, but I'd be happier at least knowing I had the option to use something else. I also like having access to <code>adb shell</code> now and then.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen plenty of people having issues with ADB before, but never without also having fastboot problems. Any ideas what might be going on? I'd prefer a Linux solution, but I can also work with Windows if needed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update:</em> I was able to get the appropriate files into /sdcard/ by simply downloading them with a web browser, then flashing them with ClockworkMod. I'm now running CM 11, and the ADB problem hasn't gone away. Whatever is causing this, it persists through complete ROM replacements.
