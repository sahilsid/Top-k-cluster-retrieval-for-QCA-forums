I charge my phone over night. Plug it in at evening (22:00), at about 1:00 (night) it finishes charging. The \"Battery full\" notification appears, and also the popup saying \"Close the charging cover for water protection\" fires up. And after that, the phone does not time out. And when I wake up, the phone is very hot. I bet it's not OK. And also, from my knowledge, static images burn into OLED displays. I really don't wanna break my phone by charging it at night.</p>\n\n<p>What I tried: restoring and leaving dev mode off. Resetting to factory, twice. Tried letting it on silent with and without vibrate. Tried putting some apps to block notifications, tried changing all the power, timeout and sensors options. Nothing stops it from lighting up and never lighting down at night, and over-heating itself. Any ideas? </p>\n","viewcount":574,"dups":[],"title":"Samsung Galaxy S5 turns on when fully charged and never turns off","tags":["notifications","lock-screen","charging","power-options","power"],"userid":"62448","related":[],"score":2,"answers":["81206","77211"],"acceptedanswer":"81206","creationdate":"2014-07-12T18:37:45.610","favoritecount":0,"comments":["100436","100446","100447","100449","100450","100451"]},"77102":{"body":"<p>Even after a factory reset when I go to settings>storage my tablet has about 120 MBS of space taken up between apps, audio, cached, and misc.

Using anything other than black text on white background reduces the effective contrast. In outdoor usage I thus have to increase screen brightness to maximum or even give up reading if I don't want to strain my eyes to the point of painfullness, where a simple black-on-white design would have allowed convenient reading. </p>\n\n<p>Sadly, smartphones (judging from my quick google search, including iphones) reduce tools for screen calibration to the brightness setting. Even the apps I found for doing adjustments on Android were actually counterproductive; E.g. ScreenAdjuster allows <em>reducing</em> but not <em>increasing</em> contrast.</p>\n\n<p>An improvement would be e.g. a way to overwrite the color settings of webpages forcing text to be black, background to be white, but while my preinstalled browser (seems to be some modification of chrome) has an inverse color mode with inproved contrast, I have yet to find a way to increase contrast without inverting colors (which I find even more straining). </p>\n\n<p>Considering that I suffer only very slight short-sightedness I can imagine that while a convenience issue to me it might be a major accesibility issue for others.</p>\n\n<p>On the desktop I'd usually use gamma-correction. It allows to squeeze some more perceived quality out of average screens, e.g. by increasing gamma for dark scenes and decreasing it for bright scenes, improving the effective contrast of the colors currently most prominent on the screen. Likewise, when a desktop program uses fine near-white shades for emphasis of text elements, a gamma adjustment can help. On Smartphones there doesn't seem to be a user-accesible gamma setting however. </p>\n\n<p>PS: On google I have seen many answers along the lines of \"increase the brightness\". Thus I want to emphasize again: I want to improve the contrast at constant (usually already maximized) screen brightness. </p>\n","viewcount":146,"dups":[],"title":"Android accessibility / convenience: Color settings","tags":["accessibility"],"userid":"37952","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["49522"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-06-10T08:59:48.373","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"42206":{"body":"<p>I just lost my phone today and I dont have any Find Me app but I am logged in with all of my information.
