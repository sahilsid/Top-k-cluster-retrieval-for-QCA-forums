More specifically I'd like to find out if it's the Android 2.2 release that added support for real dual SIM and dual GSM support, and to which extend both cards are online or usable as data channel.</p>\n\n<p>A question about <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/865/dual-sim-android-phone\">Dual SIM Android phone?</a> already came up here, but it didn't investigate the issue completely. And the mentioned mobile (Tiger G3) was also most likely incorrectly reported as Android phone. From all pictures I've seen it's a regular chinese MTK/NucleuOS phone.</p>\n\n<p>I want to base my question on the STAR A3000 as hardware example. It's verified that it is really running Android, and dual SIM capabilities seem very plausible:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=A3000\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=A3000</a><br>\nI'm linking to a search listing and not a shop or review directly to avoid the impression of spamvertizing. It's also a more long-lived link that way. But foremost I want to highlight that there are two hardware versions. The original A3000 runs Android 2.1 and offers no dual SIM capabilities. All newer listings advertise both Android 2.2 and dual SIM support.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble with chinese mobiles and resellers is that not all details are super reliable. You'll have to cross check multiple sources, and better assume the lowest common denominator. In the above shop search some Android 2.2 dual sim A3000s are for example still depicted with the original hardware version. I've seen a few images (and there's a youtube video) with the dual sim slots, so I presume this verified. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.50391\" rel=\"nofollow\">rumor (on dealextreme)</a> that both hardware versions are identical and there's just a black cover above the second sim slot for the first version (looks plausible from pictures). So that's why I assume that Android 2.1 didn't support such features, and the Android 2.2 kernel maybe introduced it.</p>\n\n<p>The hardware in this phone most likely supports not only dual SIM, but dual GSM. This means that both SIM cards are connected the whole time, to two different networks. All previous MTK chips and mobiles support that.<br>\nHowever I've seen one picture of the A3000 Android 2.2.1 version which shows a configuration screen with an option along the lines \"[x] Select SIM card at bootup\". This would suggest that it's not a real dual-GSM setup, but just dual-SIM - which only allows switching. Yet <em>all</em> the listings from my first link suggest that the phone and Android is \"dual sim dual standby\". So I'm confused.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the question: Did Android 2.2 introduce proper support for dual-GSM? I know none of the big brand vendors supports anything like that, so it must be a fringe feature, maybe not even in the OHA documentation. Any chance something like this was mentioned in some sort of release notes? (Really I have no clue, no Android phone yet, still gauging.)</p>\n\n<p>My main interest is keeping my main phone number, and using a secondary SIM and contract for data connnections preferrably. Or the other way round.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another note. I know there was also the General Mobile DSTL1 once, which was the first (and for a long time only) Android 1.5/1.6 phone to advertise dual-SIM.

I've got as far as having the USB storage activity window pop up via the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>adb shell am start -n com.android.systemui/.usb.UsbStorageActivity\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to figure out how to send the equivalent \"intent\" to actually \"unmount\" or \"unshare\" the shared volume (or \"mount\" or \"share\" it for that matter).

I've tried a whole lotta tutorials, from XDA to the rest, telling me I need to flash a new radio but the problem is I have not been able to do that because of some errors I get when using the fastboot command (permission denied to be specific from the adb command interface).

The phone was advertised as having 1GB internal Memory and also came with a 4GB Micro SD.</p>\n\n<p>I've used the phone for about a week now and noticed something which I believe is drastically wrong with the Memory Scheme. As I've downloaded apps, they seem to not be using the internal memory properly. On the Applications Manage screen, the apps take up \"System Memory\", which is about 190MB maximum. As you can imagine, this space is used up rather fast after only a few apps installed. So I tried to see if I could move apps to the SD Card, but there's the hitch. The option didn't refer to an SD card at all, but was a greyed-out \"Move to Internal Memory\". A few of the apps had this option, and when I selected it they began to take up the 1GB Internal Memory, which was not used at all before. The option for memory management then read \"Move to Phone\". Also, I noticed that as I installed more apps RAM was being used even before the Apps started running.</p>\n\n<p>My theory is that the phone was poorly configured. A section of RAM is being treated as the Internal Storage or Flash Memory or whatever you call it, which was labelled \"System Memory\". The actual, 1GB Internal memory is being treated as external storage much as an SD card would, which leaves the real SD card out in the cold.

This is a project/challenge to recover this brick. I already have a replacement. Any solutions are welcome. Motherhood comments are not necessary please. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. The recovery mode is not working on this tablet (i.e. pwr/vol+/vol-, fastboot, etc.).</p>\n","viewcount":57,"dups":[],"title":"ADB Push not keeping file permissions, specifically execute permission","tags":["adb"],"userid":"62153","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["71496"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-06-03T16:55:53.343","favoritecount":0,"comments":["95176","95183"]},"71480":{"body":"<p>I'm using <em>Samsung Galaxy fit GTS5670</em> running on Android 2.3.6.</p>\n\n<p>After installing <em>Whatsapp Messenger</em> of 13.36 MB, it was installed to phone memory.

I'm not sure what whitelist rules would be required for this. For example, SSHTunnel connects to the server at x.x.x.x:x, so I presume I'd need a rule to allow connections to this address and this port (I had a quick play with the Avast firewall, which only allows creating custom rules for IP or port, so I'd need two rules with that and it doesn't allow entering the DynDNS name, only a IP address, so that's no good).</p>\n\n<p>Then SSHTunnel has a Local Port (1984) and remote address:port (127.0.0.1:3128) so I presume I'd need rules to allow all of those as well (I'm not sure which of these need to be incoming/outgoing or both). Then there's the question of whether I need to allow other ports like DNS (53) and so on, or if that all goes over the SSH tunnel and doesn't require setting allow rules specifically.</p>\n\n<p>It might be that a VPN server would be more suitable for what I'm trying to acheive than a SSH server and I think the Tomato firmware on the router has that facility (or if the version currently flashed doesn't, there's probably another version I could flash that does), so if that's the case, I'd appreciate advice on locking it down that way instead. Android has built-in VPN support, so it might be possible to use that but it depends on whether it will auto-connect and stay connected all the time or if it requires user intervention and I'll still need to setup firewall rules to prevent data being sent without the VPN in case it does get disabled.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is whether these firewall rules will prevent the device even being able to connect to any public Wi-Fi points before redirecting the traffic via the SSH/VPN server.</p>\n","viewcount":282,"dups":[],"title":"Need help restricting Android tablet to SSH/VPN access only","tags":["vpn","ssh","firewall"],"userid":"46912","related":["2689","2962","50643"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-25T20:12:46.030","favoritecount":0,"comments":["78330"]},"8143":{"body":"<p>Ever since the Gingerbread update, my N1 has been experiencing random audio dropout problems every 5-10 minutes when connected to my car's audio system via Bluetooth.

When you have a home phone and have caller ID display in your plan, it displays the number of the person calling you as well as the name associated to that number in the phonebook. But that doesn't happen on my mobile phone.

ScreenAdjuster allows <em>reducing</em> but not <em>increasing</em> contrast.</p>\n\n<p>An improvement would be e.g. a way to overwrite the color settings of webpages forcing text to be black, background to be white, but while my preinstalled browser (seems to be some modification of chrome) has an inverse color mode with inproved contrast, I have yet to find a way to increase contrast without inverting colors (which I find even more straining). </p>\n\n<p>Considering that I suffer only very slight short-sightedness I can imagine that while a convenience issue to me it might be a major accesibility issue for others.</p>\n\n<p>On the desktop I'd usually use gamma-correction. It allows to squeeze some more perceived quality out of average screens, e.g. by increasing gamma for dark scenes and decreasing it for bright scenes, improving the effective contrast of the colors currently most prominent on the screen. Likewise, when a desktop program uses fine near-white shades for emphasis of text elements, a gamma adjustment can help. On Smartphones there doesn't seem to be a user-accesible gamma setting however. </p>\n\n<p>PS: On google I have seen many answers along the lines of \"increase the brightness\". Thus I want to emphasize again: I want to improve the contrast at constant (usually already maximized) screen brightness. </p>\n","viewcount":146,"dups":[],"title":"Android accessibility / convenience: Color settings","tags":["accessibility"],"userid":"37952","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["49522"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-06-10T08:59:48.373","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"42206":{"body":"<p>I just lost my phone today and I dont have any Find Me app but I am logged in with all of my information.

This defeats the purpose of what I am trying to do, which is to record thoughts I have while I am out and about walking, biking, driving, etc. when I can reach up and hit a button on my bluetooth phone, but I am not able to stop, pull my phone out of wherever I have it stashed, take off my gloves so I can touch the screen, power up the device, enter my lock code, jump to the record app if needed, and tap to start recording.

However, I am not sure what I would do next.  The commands offered are things like \"Go To &lt;&lt; Shortcut >>\", and \"Check &lt;&lt; Item >>\" - these are the only two that seems remotely related to what I am trying to do.  I assume that maybe if I said something like \"Go To Voice Recorder\" it might open up the voice recorder, but I couldn't get it to work and am not sure what it expects for &lt;&lt; Shortcut >>.  Even then, assuming that part would work, I would need to have some way of telling the app to start recording, for instance, if the shortcut was not just the app but a full-blown intent.  I am not sure how I would set that up.

It actually appears to be a hardware issue.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the actual issue. When held portrait with the home/options/back buttons at the bottom, about an inch or so up from those buttons there is a \"dead\" strip that runs horizontally across the entire touch screen. Of course, the keyboard pops up under this strip.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I mean by dead? Well, sometimes choosing an option/box/item that's in this zone, flat out isn't being registered. When typing, it actually causes the touch detection to go haywire. When I tap a key, it usually registers me tapping that key AND one or two of the surrounding keys. Sometimes it doesn't register the intended key just the surround keys.</p>\n\n<p>So, pressing i might return i, might return ui, might return iu, might return u. This behavior happens with most of the keyboard and is incredibly frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>On very rare occasions when I press a letter, it also registers me pressing a key on the completely otherside of the keyboard. The worst example of this is when i hit backspace and it's also registering 'c' and/or 'v' with the click.</p>\n\n<p>As to further demonstrate the issue, I downloaded a drawing app (Draw! if any one's curious) and drew a bunch of lines. It works perfectly when drawing straight lines (well, I'm human so they aren't PERFECTLY straight) up and down, and left and right on the screen.. except when I get to the deadzone. When I'm drawing down (perpendicular) through the dead zone, it works fine with no abnormalities.</p>\n\n<p>But when I draw in a parallel (left to right) direction, when i'm inside the zone it basically draws my straight line has harsh zig-zag lines (ever seen a heart rate monitor?). Additionally some spots in the zone won't be drawn on at all.</p>\n\n<p>Another note to further show that it's a consistent hardware issue: this zone stays in the same place, no matter if I'm holding it portrait or landscape. I'm forced to type on my phone with it being held upside down so the deadzone doesn't go through my keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>I know (well, pretty certain) this is a hardware issue and there's probably no real solution for this phone. But is there any documentation, known issues, reasoning behind this issue?

Although it is rooted and I can apply a custom ROM to it, I have not done so yet for several reasons I won't get into but my issue should be independent of that. This phone is by far (in my humble opinion) one of the best and most stable piece of hardware that HTC has produced to date and I couldn't be happier with the phone, hence why I have not upgraded to a newer device. I know the older OS is a turn off to many and I agree that I wish I was running a higher version but most of them don't honor the latest drivers available which means you lose 4G functionality among other things. So I have stuck with it for now until such time as an updated drivers are released (doubtful but one can hope).</p>\n\n<p>I have an 8 GB SD card (7.39 GB usable) and 4.05 GB free - since I move anything that has the option to run off the SD card to external storage. I have 500 MB internal storage (427 MB usable) and a little over 60 MB free. I have never had issues updating anything since the space present has always been enough to install or update before moving stuff to free more space.</p>\n\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n\n<p>Recently when updating apps it often gives me the <code>insufficient storage available</code> message – but it makes no sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Storage facts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>external SD with 8 GB (4 GB free)</li>\n<li>internal storage with 500 MB (60 MB free)</li>\n<li>example problematic app: apk size ~6 MB / installed size 11.46 MB</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Detailed problem (again: TL;DR)</h3>\n\n<p>Specifically the app that is giving the problem recently is Lookout Security &amp; Antivirus which has never been an issue and is only 6 MB and change but it will download it and when attempting to install pops that error. I don't get how a 6 MB file that has never had issue updating on less than 40 MB space is now giving me problems with over 60 MB free? The baffling part is that occasionally it WILL actually update just fine without issue and I have checked my cache and stuff, nothing there, no other apps running that would hog space or anything, so what's wrong? How can I mitigate this? Another bizarre thing that started to happen is that internal apps like Facebook which are bloated on there whether I like it or not and I use rarely are giving me problems too by issuing the invalid page file error. I mean what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what's going on here? What is wrong or what can I do to make it right</strong> so it stops being stupid like this? As I said, NEVER had a single issue with this phone, EVER, but in the past month it has driven me absolutely NUTS. I have even uninstalled applications that don't provide the move to SD option to free up nominal space and it stabilizes for like 2 days and then bam, back to square one even though it has more space now. I am at my wits end and I would appreciate the help; especially not being a novice this is even more mind boggling to me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 10/26/13 @7:45 AM</strong>\nThe application updated normally without giving the error and it did so while the internal storage had only 43 MB (as opposed to the 60 MB when it failed numerously). This lends itself to even more confusion as to what is going on.

The answer seems to be no for that particular potential solution.</p>\n\n<p>When I go to the market and am notified of many of my apps having been updated, I have the option to 'Update All'.

If the app is stored on the SD card, doing it this way should mean there is as much room left on the internal storage as before the previous update was applied, so the next can proceed and hopefully succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Given that there doesn't seem to be a way to queue apps for updates (according to the answer to the above linked question), are there any other ways to avoid this problem?</p>\n\n<p>Checking for updates more frequently in order to have smaller simultaneous batches is all I can really come up with for now.</p>\n","viewcount":208,"dups":[],"title":"Is there a way to avoid disk space errors when batch updating apps (using 'Update All')?","tags":["applications","update","internal-storage"],"userid":"4769","related":["8659"],"score":8,"answers":["12060","12061"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-04-30T15:28:42.440","favoritecount":1,"comments":["10546","10547","10549","10552"]},"8780":{"body":"<p>I need to get detailed request data times on Samsung Galaxy Tab on Verison network.
