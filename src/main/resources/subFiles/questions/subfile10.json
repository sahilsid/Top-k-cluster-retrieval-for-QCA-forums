But I admit that I am no expert in rooting and/or flashing Android phones, and the last sentence might have been an extremely nooby statement.

However, there's no fixed period. It varies between 1 and 5 minutes, even though I had 2-3 cases where it worked properly for ~15 mins. I am suspecting that the moment the phone's networking hardware/software goes over a certain load, the problem occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Steps I didn't try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flash a new ROM. Thing is, THL don't have more recent ROMs than the one I got the phone with when buying it off a friend. He downloaded the latest image from THL's website and flashed it, then rooted it. We never tried using unofficial ROMs.</li>\n<li>Flash only the radio software. (I don't have an idea how this could be done, though.)</li>\n<li>Call my mobile provider to ask if my IMEI is blacklisted. Or if they have a malfunctioning cell in the area. (Still though, that can't explain why the problem does occur 6km away in a park as well, so I don't think a malfunctioning tower/cell is to be blamed).</li>\n<li>Go to repair shop for diagnostic/repair of the internal antenna. I would like to leave that as a last resort. From what I hear, this could easily cost $100. And that phone costed me $200. If I have to do this, I might just go and buy a brand new Galaxy S4 as well. Still, I don't want to just throw it away. Obviously, even if I replace it, I'd like to be able to sell it and <em>not</em> burn the guy I sell it to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am out of ideas now.

However I noticed that only 200-300 MB's are left and marked \"unused\". Also I know that does not necessarily mean that all \"used\" RAM is really in use. For example cached Apps may be held in RAM for faster start-up and this RAM may be freed by Android if more memory is needed. So I tried the following steps to get more unused RAM as I am experiencing Force-Closes from another App which (may) result from insufficient memory available.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I checked running apps and force-closed some of them but this gave me not enough RAM. Although this list contains Apps which may be responsible for almost 100 MBs of RAM but not for 600 MB. So I checked which Apps are cached, and closed all of them giving me also only a few MB's.</p></li>\n<li><p>I rebooted my device but after start-up 600 MB's are already used.</p></li>\n<li><p>I performed cold-boot still 600 MB's are already in use.</p></li>\n<li><p>I pushed the reset button which immediately shut down my device, but after reboot 600 MB's are still in use.</p></li>\n<li><p>I performed a factory reset and did not installed any other app (nor did I perform a backup-restore, as I hadn't specified any Google account so far).

Except <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hala01.advancedmemorybooster&amp;feature=search_result\" rel=\"nofollow\">one profiler</a> gave me a hint: It sayed that 300 MB's are used by the kernel and 300 MB's are used by apps. It also provided me a button for killing all running apps. Directly after this still 200 MB's are in use (it says \"kernel memory\") but after 15min again 600 MB's in use (with again 300 MB's per kernel- and app-memory). Is that normal that so much memory is used?, I mean this is factory reset no additional apps were installed by myself!</p></li>\n<li><p>I also tried to to force-close and disable almost all apps which are currently running and which I don't need but still around 600 MB's are in use.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I fear to lose warranty if I open the back of the pad I cannot put off power.
