This has happened on both my current ROM (Miui) and every version of Cyanogenmod I've tried.</p>\n\n<p>Usually this problem crops up again a few months after a fresh ROM install or factory reset. I'll switch from 3G to Wifi, or vise versa, and then everything on my phone that uses background data will start force closing. The most usual suspects are Google Services Framework (com.google.process.gapps) and Facebook (com.facebook.katana), but almost any app seems to force close including ScoreCenter, Docs, and Smooth Calendar.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the force closes, the other big symptom is that I can't turn off or on airplane mode, mobile network data (3G), wifi, or background data syncing - but usually not all at the same time. Sometimes I'll be able to turn on Wifi but not airplane mode, or other times I'll be able to turn 3G off but Wifi won't turn off. Sometimes I'll be able to turn a service off or on after a reboot, other times not. Sometimes when I reboot a service that I turned off before will be back on again, other times not. Incredibly, utterly frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Neither rebooting, fixing permissions, nor wiping dalvik cache seem to help. I've only ever gotten my phone to work again by fiddling around with the radio settings and pulling the battery for hours before something magically starts working again.

The notes were saved using the ActiveNotes application, which is not available on Android, only on Symbian. ActiveNotes saves the notes as HTML files, which I can easily view on Android using the HTML viewer or web browser, or any other html reader (such as Dolphin).</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to use the built-in copy/paste functionality by touch-and-hold then \"select all\" and copy. This does not seem to work in HTML viewer, but does work in the browser or Dolphin. However, ActiveNotes stores the newlines in my notes using paragraph tags (HTML &lt;p&gt; tags) and these are not correctly copied by the built-in text copier. Because of this, all the text appears as one long string, without any line breaks, when I paste it into my Android notes application (or indeed any Android notes application such as Messaging). This is very annoying as many of my notes are in excess of 100 lines long.</p>\n\n<p>A number of copy/paste apps seem to be available which use the \"Share Page\" option on the menu. I use this when accessing my page through a URL through Astro, so the URL looks something like \"content://com.metago.astro.filesystem/mnt/sdcard/Activenotes/NoteNameHere.html?text/plain\". The two copy/paste apps I tried were \"Any Web Copy\" and \"Copy To Clipboard\". The latter seems to always copy just the URL (rather than the page content) to the clipboard. The former copies the web page text to the clipboard for \"http://\" links but refuses to for these \"content://\" links. Even when the web page text is copied to the clipboard (e.g. from an internet page), it still seems to be devoid of any newlines for much of the page.</p>\n\n<p>Since the source of these files is actually viewable (e.g. in the plain text editor) there MUST be a way to copy the content of the pages including newlines. I could do this conversion myself on PC manually for every single file, but this would take a very long time and I would much rather be able to convert files on-demand on my phone using the above method. However, I am at a bit of a loss as to how to preserve the newlines.

In fact, I remember taking a look at a paper demonstrating that even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gutmann algorithm</a> is <em>not</em> effective on flash drives. For example, <a href=\"http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2256804\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> we find evidence that tools such as Eraser or CCleaner will not handle it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>You can't just overwrite a file to securely erase on a flash drive due to internal logical to physical remapping of flash blocks by the\n  controller. When you overwrite a file, the new contents will simply go\n  to the next free flash block. The old block will be erased later by\n  the controller during idle/garbage collection cycles, but only if no\n  other files are using parts of that block. Until that happens, the\n  contents of the old file will still reside in that flash block</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>The only way to securely erase a flash memory drive without a built in secure erase function is to completely overwrite the entire media\n  to full capacity such that there are no more free flash blocks so that\n  every block must be erased and overwritten.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even so, I am still not sure if overwriting the entire drive would do the trick, because I remember something like flash drives have some sort of extra space used to prevent decrease of total space due to damages to specific areas of the memory during its lifetime. And this extra storage would not be normally accessible by these usual tools and procedures.</p>\n\n<p>About internal storage, I am not sure if I trust Nuke My Phone either, specially because I want to erase whole phone, not automatically selected parts of it. I also do not understand well how a simple app would have such permission to wipe all of \"your data\" which I would assume may include not just your documents but settings from other applications, all this without rooting.</p>\n\n<p>I could not find not even an explanation on the hardware architecture of internal storage, which is necessary since every kind of storage device has its own particularities and, if ever possible, their own secure erasing techniques.</p>\n\n<p>So in sum, I would really appreciate documentation <em>proving</em> that physical deletion is indeed possible both for external SD cards, with their flash drive architecture, and internal storage, whatever architecture is used there.

What do I mean by this? The most egregious and obvious example is while typing, occasionally my keyboard will find it pertinent to, without prompting, close about 95% of the way, stall, then open and close in quick succession many times in an unpredictable fashion. This makes typing very difficult as when I go to type, the phone will sometimes make it impossible to access the keyboard. While it does this odd stutter, the normal \"back\" button shows the \"close keyboard\" icon. When tapped, the keyboard will continue its stuttering until it realizes I wanted it to close, when it closes. I've tried reinstalling the keyboard, resetting the phone to factory settings, and different keyboards like swiftkey.</p>\n\n<p>Along with this keyboard malfunction is the unfortunate glitch in the phone itself, where if it feels like it, the phone will mute and unmute so fast that neither me nor the person on the other end can make out what the other is saying.</p>\n\n<p>More recently some of the system sounds, such as notifications, have begun stuttering.

A couple months ago my OS was updated to Android 2.3. Since then I've had a weird problem with my calendar events. </p>\n\n<p>I can view calendar events just fine, and the calendar syncs with my Google Account bi-directionally without issue.</p>\n\n<p>When I create a calendar event, the \"time zone\" option defaults to my current time zone, \"GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time\", just like it did on Android 2.2. However, when I touch the time zone option to select a time zone, there are two time zone entries that match mine. One is \"GMT -4, Eastern Standard Time\", the other is \"GMT -4, Eastern Time\".</p>\n\n<p>The problem happens when I edit an event. Frequently, when I edit a calendar entry, the event jumps 4 hours ahead unless I manually edit it back down. For example, if I create a calendar event and set the starting time to 1:00pm, when I edit the event I've created the edit screen will show a starting time of 5:00pm. It still shows the correct time zone, but it adds the 4 hour GMT difference into the event's starting time. If I save the event without adjusting it back down, the next time I edit it it will say 9:00pm. This happens regardless of whether the event was originally created on the phone, or if it was created on my desktop PC by visiting <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/calendar</a>. It doesn't seem to matter which of the two \"US Eastern Time\" options I select when creating an event on the phone. This problem did not exist before I installed Android 2.3. It doesn't happen with every single event, but I haven't been able to figure out what the common element is between the unaffected events. It does seem that events that are freshly-created are less prone to this problem (possibly the problem starts after the data's been synced a few times?)</p>\n\n<p>If I create a calendar event on my phone, and then edit it on my desktop PC using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/calendar</a>, the PC edit screen behaves normally, and the changes sync back to my phone without issue. Only when editing events on the phone do I experience this problem.</p>\n\n<p>It's very annoying that I have to dial my events back 4 hours every time I make a change to them.

It has Google Market. The market version is 1.713 - which is nowhere near the latest IIRC.

Probably some kind of CyanogenMod interference. Any good way around that, please?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: debugged the situation a little bit. I happen to know that market updating happens out of the main Market process - the Market (com.android.vending) downloads the update, then fires a broadcast intent UPDATE_MARKET to a receiver in another app (com.android.vending.updater), which in turn installs the package. Here's what I got in the LogCat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>02-01 02:34:16.155: W/ActivityManager(121): Permission Denial:\n  broadcasting Intent { act=com.android.vending.UPDATE_MARKET\n  dat=content://downloads/download/31 } from com.android.vending\n  (pid=1762, uid=10006) requires\n  com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET due to receiver\n  com.android.vending.updater/com.android.vending.updater.UpdateMarketReceiver</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it looks as if the Market app lacks a permission to invoke the updater. The manifest file of Vending.apk, however, does have a </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name=\"com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET\" /&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>line. How is it possible for an app to have a <code>&lt;uses-permission&gt;</code>, but receive a permission denial message?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: the permission com.android.vending.permission.UPDATE_MARKET is marked as \"signature\" in the MarketUpdater manifest. Meaning only apps signed by the same certificate as MarketUpdater are granted that permission. That could be the reason Market is not granted the permission - could be signed by a different certificate.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: that's exactly the case. The public key is different.

Backing up the library does not upload that image again online, and the Cloud-icon remains.</p>\n\n<p>Of course once you think you know the system it gets more complicated. Using Hangouts also puts those images inside a separate folder online, and for some reason some pictures only show up there and NOT inside the <em>Auto-Backup</em> folder.

The cloud-icon would suggest to me that it's available online, but it's still there even after deleting the image online. Of course deleting it online means you don't want it.\nAlso it's not really syncing if the images on the device are not the same as online. There can be images on the device but not online and vice-versa.

The phone is stock Gingerbread, not rooted, and I don't download any dubious or non-Market apps.  While using my phone today it suddenly rebooted.  Upon reaching the unlock screen, neither the screen nor the buttons would respond to any kind of input, nor have they since.  I can't even turn on the screen by pressing the power button; I have to plug it in to the charger.  The only way to try to restart is to pull the battery.  It seems to me that the problem is with the unlock screen, which I think belongs to the launcher app.  The menu bar at the top of the screen seems to indicate that other systems are functioning properly -- the clock in the corner stays up to date, while the lock screen's clock doesn't change after booting.

I've had this installed for almost 1 year now, and haven't made any updates or installed any apps for months.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, I connected the phone to my laptop to transfer some stuff, and I noticed that the touch screen wasn't responding. Neither did the Android buttons, which I suspect use the same touch sensor as the screen. Everything else seemed fine, physical buttons (power, volume) work ok, the phone is detected when connected to usb, notifs on screen and such work ok.</p>\n\n<p>After multiple trial &amp; errors, I've discovered that if I shut down my phone, and re-start it, when it gets to the screen where I must input my SIM Pin code, the touch screen is still not working, but if I wait like 1-2 minutes, it starts working. From here on end it works fine until I close (lock) the phone. At that point if I press the power button to unlock it, the lock screen is unoperable as the touch screen no longer responds. I can re-do this over and over.</p>\n\n<p>My question is then: anyone has an idea what this can be and how to fix it? For example on my Asus tablet, there's a hard reset option (hold volume down and power while rebooting). I've used this to cure that Asus tablet of the fact that sound was no longer working all of a sudden. I haven't managed to find a similar option for Optimus LG 2x. </p>\n\n<p>Also, is it safe to assume that the screen is not phisically broken, since a reboot and 2-3 minutes of waiting makes it so that it works just fine?</p>\n\n<p>=== UPDATE</p>\n\n<p>This really sucks. I've whiped everything and installed the latest cyanogen mod. Still the same issue. Simply put: the screen has to stay on for like 2-3 minutes before the touch starts to work.

Given the application developer has provided one layout only (for small devices) and the app is being run on a large display.

I have spent the last 4 hours scouring 100's of forum posts, reading ADB documentation, looking through wiki articles trying to learn the ins-and-outs of recovery roms, flashing, etc., and I still don't have a working solution -- not because the things I've tried haven't worked, but because information is so obscure and vague that I have no idea what to try.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Droid Razr Maxx HD Global. The screen and digitizer are both broken. I have a new identical working device. I want to transfer <em>everything</em> -- system settings, app data, etc. -- from the old device to the new device. It's easy enough to move the SIM and external SD to the new device but I still have the issue of internal storage.</p>\n\n<p>The phone is stock. USB debugging is disabled. I can't use ADB because of that. I also can't use tools like MobileTrans (or whatever) because of that. I can't enable USB debugging because I need the screen. <strike>I don't have a USB On-The-Go and I don't even know if it would work with my device. I don't have an HDMI cable or a monitor that accepts HDMI.</strike> I have tried multiple USB On-The-Go adapters and multiple mice and none of the mice are recognized. I have an HDMI cable and an HDMI monitor which works but does not help with the digitizer issue.</p>\n\n<p>The most promising looking path I see so far is to install a ROM that has USB debugging enabled. Maybe it's a regular ROM, maybe it's a recovery ROM, I have no idea. I have this RSDLite tool that I guess flashes regular ROMs, or maybe recovery ROMs, or both, I can't tell. I have a regular and recovery Cyanogen ROM image. RSDLite can't load it. RSDLite doesn't show my device. I saw a few people say \"oh just boot into fastboot and use that\". Ok I'll just, uh, press the \"boot into fastboot and use it\" button? I have no idea what fastboot is other than a tool that I have in my ADB installation.</p>\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/a/12887/46219\">this answer</a>, which recommends typing <code>setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1</code> somewhere, although I don't know where. The poster says, amusingly, <em>\"The Droid X does not have a physical keyboard - but if it did you could try this in a terminal.\"</em> Anybody have any ideas about this one? My imaginary keyboard on my Razr doesn't work either. (Update: This requires screen access and a terminal on the phone, so, as per usual, that doesn't actual answer the question that was asked.)</p>\n\n<p>I did try \"using\" (fsv of \"using\") fastboot to boot with the Cyanogen recovery ROM (which may or may not be the correct ROM and may or may not have debugging enabled and I don't actually know if \"boot\" permanently modifies the device or not):</p>\n\n<pre><code>fastboot boot /path/to/some_arbitrary_rom_i_got_on_the_internet.img\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it just got stuck on <code>&lt;waiting for device&gt;</code> and eventually gave up, something that all the answers involving fastboot seem to neglect to address. Not really sure how to proceed there, or if that's even the right path to be going down. (Update: Apparently the power + volume down button boot menu is called \"fastboot\" mode -- odd that it's this easy when all mentions of \"fastboot mode\" on the internet seem to involve some huge chain of drivers, weird tools, and arcane commands and never mentioned that on Motorola devices it's just the plain old boot menu. I will try this when I get home from work.)</p>\n\n<p>The flood of advice like \"yes just select X and Y in the boot menu\" seems to help nobody with this problem because, obviously, the screen is broken.</p>\n\n<p><em>HOW</em> (keyword: <em>HOW</em>) do I <em>somehow</em> enable USB debugging on a device with a broken screen? Do I use fastboot for something? Do I find a ROM of some sort with USB debugging enabled? What ROMs have USB debugging enabled (it's not exactly something listed in their feature list)? How do I <em>actually</em> do this?</p>\n\n<p>Minor rant: It's amazing how massive the headache is compared to how conceptually simple the problem (need to enable one setting and can't) is. Given that <a href=\"http://www.squaretrade.com/htm/pdf/cell_phone_comparison_study_nov_10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">drop damage is the most common cause of accidental smartphone failure</a> and that USB debugging is required to transfer system data (for some reason the Android folks tied the concept of \"transferring data\" to \"development tool\"), it boggles the mind why there isn't a more robust interface for this or at least a non-arcane working how-to out there somewhere for people who reasonably don't want to spend a week of their life becoming an expert on Android kernel image development and debugging.</p>\n","viewcount":2789,"dups":[],"title":"Enable USB debugging on Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD Global with no screen","tags":["adb","data-recovery","fastboot","usb-debugging","motorola-droid-razr"],"userid":"46219","related":["36860","51536","12834","36224"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-15T01:33:17.550","favoritecount":1,"comments":["77478","77479","77501","77502","77504","77544","77558","77561","77566","77570","77579","77581","77583","77589","99033"]},"2790":{"body":"<p>So I try to send a tweet from hootsuite about this really nice beer I had.

I was a little wary of overclocking my CPU, having heard it may decrease its life expectancy, but finally I thought \"What the heck?\" and in a brilliant stroke of genius cranked my 1Ghz processor up to 1.5Ghz, and it promptly froze, forcing me to power it down. When I turned it back on, I discovered that it had been factory reset. I re-installed my apps, including the system-tweak app, and decided not to touch the CPU controls for a while. Soon after, while at my sister's talent show, I discovered I had about 30% battery life, and I was still supposed to record her. So I figured I'd underclock it to save the battery. Unfortunately, as my finger touched the slider, my brother bumped my arm and caused me to lower the CPU frequency to its lowest setting. It became extremely sluggish, almost to the point of being unresponsive, and finally I had to shut it down. When I restarted it, it started to boot but then got stuck on the shimmering Android logo, and now that's all it does.

The information on rooting Android devices seems heavily fragmented across the web and the tools unreliable.  At least in my case, <em>SuperOneClick</em> has proven a complete misnomer.  So I'd like to go back to basics - executing as many of the commands as possible from a Linux terminal to get the phone rooted/unlocked/whatever else has to happen to get Cyanogenmod installed.

I'm prompted to confirm the phone is a Google Nexus One and then ROM Manager runs for about 30 seconds (yellow program bar goes all the way) before spitting out <em>An error occurred while attempting to run privileged commands!</em>.  And this is the point I am stuck at.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I should note that at no point am I prompted by the SuperUser app to give the ROM Manager app super user permissions.  I don't restart the phone or do anything else throughout all of the steps I've described above, so I can't see any reason for root to have been lost at any point.  In fact, if I execute the command <code>sudo ./adb shell</code> after all this, I still get the <code>#</code> prompt indicating root.  And when I execute <code>id</code> afterwards, I get <code>uid=0(root) gid=0(root)</code> -- further confirmation of root.  I really am stuck on this one.  I've spent a lot of time digging through forum posts and online articles, but the signal to noise ratio is poor and I haven't been able to find anything that actually works.

As well as the bottom explaining my device &amp; set up.</em></p>\n\n<p>The best method I would think of, to do this, would obviously be to do this after a factory restore, and data wipe. But considering I am way past that point, I am trying to find another method. </p>\n\n<p>I already backup all the applications I need, using Titanium Backup, so I don't want to backup my apps that will probably be different at the point of recovery, or will have certain apps I ditched before the point of restore, or have certain configurations I don't use/need/etc. I could go on and on. But the point Is I would just like to backup my stock rom, kernel, with my Super User privileges, without anything else. So I can basically use it as a factory reset, by just flashing my rom. </p>\n\n<p>The main reason I ask this, is because I tend to get big into customization. Recently I used a font installer, form Rom Toolbox, and basically bricked my phone by getting caught in a boot loop. It would never pass to boot animation. So I had to use an old Odin Image with Clockwork Recovery. That was all I had. Luckily that fixed it, but I would like to make my own recovery images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But, really the best thing I would just love, yet I am not sure whether it is possible, or as customizable, is it would be great if their was a way to just pick and choose what you want, or don't want to backup to a single image file.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Like an application that lets you choose certain things: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>System</li>\n<li>Root</li>\n<li>Kernel</li>\n<li>Applications with or without caches, data, accounts, and settings, etc.</li>\n<li>System Settings</li>\n<li>Account Settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...you get the point...</p>\n\n<p>Now there wouldn't happen to be something like this for backups would there? Or is that just a dream of mine? </p>\n\n<p>Even though right now, I would prefer to just backup only my system without everything else, like apps. Maybe one day in the future I may like to be able to backup other things as well. Which is why I ask. Might as well use a \"one backup to rule them all\" method if it exists. But if not that's fine, I could always just backup the system itself, and continue to use Titanium.</p>\n\n<p>Now that, that is covered, what are all the different methods of backups? Odin. Nandroid. Anything else? What do they cover, and how customizable, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Ive been looking into this for the past week, but I am having trouble finding something that is relevant to what I am looking for. And all the information regarding backups seems quite specific to certain devices, and custom roms. \nWhich puts me kind of at a fallback, as I have a pretty uncommon device, with a pretty default rom. </p>\n\n<p>I have a Samsung Conquer 4G (SPH-D600) With the FE16 firmware update, on a stock rom with root, with a slight mod of having ClockworkMod Recovery. </p>\n\n<p>So when I press and hold the: \"Volume Down, &amp; Power button\" it takes me to a \"ClockworkMod based recovery mode\" (according to what it says on the header on the screen.) </p>\n\n<p>So that's what I am working with. </p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts on this selective backup utilities I am thinking off? Any good resources I should look into on this topic? as well as any other information you may find relevant to this situation that you would care to share? </p>\n\n<p>I would greatly appreciate any input on the subject, as android backups aren't a topic I know much of anything on, and cant really find any good resources on the subject myself. \nSo any and all help is appreciated. Even just links are great.

I tried to get a Motorola H350 headset to work, but it failed. Then I tried a Sprint Jawbone headset and it synced, but in Skype the microphone in it didn't work and it was using the microphone on the Galaxy Tab instead. I mean, I walked away from my tab and said \"testing 1, 2, 3\", and couldn't hear it. Instead, I heard someone near my tab saying, \"testing a, b, c\".</p>\n\n<p>Second, I don't know if it's just a Skype issue or the Galaxy Tab hardware that's preventing Skype from picking up my voice over the paired bluetooth headset. Or perhaps it's the headset. Or perhaps I must use only a Samsung-brand headset.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, I want to use Skype calling on my Galaxy tab, and purchase a headset that lets me use the microphone in the headset.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone gotten this to work? What's the trick?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I have since purchased <a href=\"http://amzn.com/dp/B004FGNUH0/?tag=bettelearn-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">these wireless headphones</a> which also include a built-in mic. These sync'd up for audio output, but in Skype I could not get audio input. So, I then temporarily rooted my device (thank you z4 root tool) and edited /system/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf to enable some settings that Verizon Wireless and/or Samsung disables in the unit. I then reset the unit and did the headset repairing again. In the end, Skype would not do audio input from the headset. But I noticed this, however. The microphone on the Galaxy Tab is outstanding. It collects the audio input in such a way that drowns out background sound. So, in a sense, you can still use the headset with the tab and walk around in your cubicle, or even talk on a crowded bus, and for the most part it will clearly pick up your voice. It's a nice compromise since headsets with mics don't seem to work with the Galaxy Tab. This might be a symptom of Skype. Their tech support says they don't support audio routing through the headset. However, I noticed that headset audio on the Galaxy Tab also doesn't work with every other app I've tried as well.</p>\n","viewcount":25388,"dups":[],"title":"Help pairing bluetooth headset/microphone with Samsung Galaxy Tab & Skype?","tags":["bluetooth","samsung-galaxy-tab","skype","bluetooth-pairing"],"userid":"1513","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["3856","4424","5324","8363","5037","4137"],"acceptedanswer":"4137","creationdate":"2010-12-19T07:44:37.100","favoritecount":0,"comments":["4633","4861","6695"]},"34635":{"body":"<p>I would like to know what measures or steps etc that should be performed, in order to protect &amp; safeguard whatever \"data\" is on my Android Smartphone or Tablet, and indeed the device itself, in the event it goes missing or is stolen.
