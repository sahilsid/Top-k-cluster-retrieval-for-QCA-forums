It upsets me greatly, especially since I recently purchased a $300 set of Bose headphones (Quietcomfort 20) that are specifically made for Android devices. I've even tried three apps from the Google Play store that purport to make the inline control work—none of them do, however. Why is this happening and, more importantly, how can I fix this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>07/30/2014 EDIT:</strong><br>\nSo I've been using this Moto X plus QC20 headphones for several months now, using the recommended <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outsidesource.klipschcontrol\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klipsch Control app</a> to allow the button on the QC20 to work better. Well, it only seems to work about 50% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>I have yet to figure out what is causing the interference, but some days, the button works perfectly. Other days, it will work, but it may take anywhere from 0 to 15 seconds before a button press is actually registered by the Klipsch Control app. It just seems to be completely random. Still other days, the button doesn't work at all.</p>\n\n<p>It might have something to do with either the time of day and/or when the headphones are plugged in / removed. For example, one morning, it'll work fine. Then I unplug the headphones and go to lunch. Returning from lunch, I plug the headphones back in and the button no longer works. Or the reverse could be true: The button doesn't work before lunch, but works great after.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this odd behavior, I'm sure you can see why I am fearful of unplugging the headphones for the rest of the day once the button on them starts working. I know that if I unplug them and plug them back in later, I only have a 50% chance of the button working.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense. More importantly, I hope someone can see some sort of pattern that I have yet to see in this behavior to identify the cause(s) of this problem.

After several tries, a friend of mine advice to \"mark all messages as read\" immediately after setting accounts to prevent excessive traffic usages. At first, this doesn't make sense to me, but he explained that some old Windows-based email clients were acting in that way (unread messages were constantly downloaded over and over again). Interestingly, it worked. But, after using it for a while (precisely 1-2 days), \"Onavo Count\" started to warn me again about that email client consumes too much traffic. While investigating the problem, I've noticed that for a single check, it consumes 1-3 MiB traffic even though I've marked all messages as read.

The excerpt from the article in question here is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All these screen dimming/color cast applications function in\n  essentially the same way: by overlaying a graphic on the screen to\n  reduce the brightness and/or change the color cast of the screen.\n  Think of it like adding a partially opaque layer to an image in\n  Photoshop. When you tell the Lux application, for example, that you\n  want the screen 50 percent dimmer than the actual hardware in the\n  phone can provide via LED adjustments, the application essentially\n  cheats by layering a gray mask over the screen that decreases the\n  brightness because the screen elements are darker. Other apps like\n  Screen Adjuster, Darker, Easy Eye, Twilight, and even the brightness\n  adjustment function in popular battery-saving app JuiceDefender all\n  work the same way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>So if the screen brightness applications (like Lux) only add a partially opaque layer they are essentially not dimming the backlight (<em>correct me if I am wrong here</em>) so in turn it would not have any affect in battery life. Right?</p></li>\n<li><p>The article continues saying – <em>Anything that layers something over the screen in anyway disables the “Install” button as the button is rendered unclickable in order to prevent malicious software from creating a false overlay that leads the user to think an application has a different set of permissions or that the application is an entirely different app altogether</em>. So does reducing the screen brightness via Settings uses some other technique (probably it actually reduces the backlight)?</p></li>\n</ol>\n","viewcount":88,"dups":[],"title":"How does reducing brightness of screen increase battery life?","tags":["applications","screen-brightness"],"userid":"30106","related":["69196"],"score":3,"answers":["82322","82314"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-09-10T12:55:34.347","favoritecount":0,"comments":["105434","105524"]},"65297":{"body":"<p>I am connected to the internet via an ethernet cable on my laptop pc.

After following the steps the first time, nothing happened to the phone's interface, so I did it a second time. This time, when it rebooted at the end of the installation, It got past the first two screens (name of model, and just \"Samsung\"), then it turned off.</p>\n  \n  <p>What I've tried so far: First I tried applying the stock images (about 10 Mb, from <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34463311#post34463311\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34463311#post34463311</a>) through ODIN, but that made no difference, except that in one of the boot modes, instead of the Clockwork interface I, get the default interface (the background having an Android alien on its back, and a red triangle with an exclamation point above it). In these interfaces, I also wiped pretty much all that I could wipe, but to no avail.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next I tried applying two of the stock ODIN images (500-600 Mb, from the same link) through ODIN, but when it starts with the SMD, I get a message \"SMD header check fail: boot.img\" on my phone, and ODIN thinks for a while, then stops, saying 1 fails and 0 successes.</p>\n  \n  <p>So here I am, asking for help. Would any of you have any ideas, or explanations (in layman's terms!) of what has happened / what I should do to get my phone useable again? Thanks in advance.</p>\n  \n  <p>P.S. Also, I should mention I'm doing all the accessing through VMWare Fusion running Windows XP, on Mac OS 10.7.5</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks for any and all opinions on this!</p>\n","viewcount":358,"dups":[],"title":"Galaxy Rugby LTE not turning on after failed custom ROM install","tags":["custom-rom","boot-loop"],"userid":"33526","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["49921"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-05-07T03:22:18.140","favoritecount":0,"comments":["60835","78920"]},"44982":{"body":"<p>When I lock my Samsung Galaxy Nexus by pushing the power button, my phone's screen darkens for a few seconds, then keeps staying awake with the lock screen displayed.
