I've tried all of the usual things like clearing the app cache and rebooting the phone. I also downloaded a 150 MB \"Gapps\" package from cyanogenmod.org that I have no idea what to do with. The <a href=\"http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Google_Apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">download page</a> has absolutely no instructions, nor does the package contain a readme. I've read that I need to \"flash the apps through recovery\", which I can sort of parse, but all of the documentation and explanations I've found this afternoon assume the reader knows more than I do.</p>\n\n<p>Any guidance would be very much appreciated.

A couple of days ago, I decided to update my Tab to JellyBean, and I searched the web for its procedure</p>\n\n<p>I found a <a href=\"http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-tab-p1000-android-4-1-1-jelly-bean-cyanogenmod-10-cm10-106995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HowTo at AndroidAuthority</a>. After downloading the files and placing them on the internal SD, I followed its procedure about the recovery mode. My tab started to update but in the middle of upgrading it stopped and restarted.</p>\n\n<p>After that, my tab continuously follows this trend 1. Booting 2. Loading the OS 3. Rebooting 4. Go to 1! I could not even return its OS to is previous state!</p>\n\n<p><strong>I could not even go to the Recovery mode to do something.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Someone told me that each phone has a ROM or something like downgrading thing which I should download it and follow another procedure. I think I should do something like formatting and reinstalling a fresh, brand new Android OS on it like the procedure when we want to install a new Windows OS on our PC.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody by any chance know what should I do?</p>\n","viewcount":5199,"dups":[],"title":"Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (GT P1000 with 2.2version android) stuck in boot-loop on update to CM10","tags":["samsung-galaxy-tab","downgrade","boot-loop"],"userid":false,"related":[],"score":1,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-10-18T17:50:08.583","favoritecount":0,"comments":["46838","46839"]},"32018":{"body":"<p>I have an HTC device which we use for development currently running Android 2.2.1.

Today my phone (modded with Cyanogen mod) started bootlooping. So, I did a ClockworkMod backup and went about installing the latest version of Cyanogen mod. When that was done, I restored the backup, but it started bootlooping yet again.

I know there are a lot of threads like this on the internet, but I want to go a bit deeper.</p>\n\n<p>I have an HTC Wildfire S with only 512 MB internal flash memory. This internal memory has a partition layout allocation around 130 MB for the <code>/data</code> partition and around 290 MB for the <code>/system</code> partition. Both of them are full. (In addition I got a 16 GB SD-card.)</p>\n\n<p>Installing apps, upgrading apps, running most of the apps - impossible. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I knew it's possible to move apps to SD-card, the so called <strong>apps2sd</strong> procedure which offers very limited functionality to move <em>some</em> of the application data to the SD-card. Anyways after moving every possible data to SD the internal memory was still full and the phone unusable.</p>\n\n<p>I was <a href=\"http://www.android-hilfe.de/anleitungen-fuer-htc-wildfire-s/290325-howto-permanent-root-link2sd-apps2sd-data2sd-init-d-deodexed-re-odex.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reading</a> about more sustainable methods like <strong>data2sd</strong>. I gave it a try. I used the instructions from htcdev.com to <a href=\"http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader\" rel=\"nofollow\">unlock the bootloader</a>, I <a href=\"http://androidjinn.com/htc-wildfire-s-root-clockworkmod-recovery-installation.html/2\" rel=\"nofollow\">installed</a> the latest ClockWorkMod Recovery and rooted the device permanently.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I used the rooted device to install <a href=\"http://www.teamandroid.com/2013/01/22/update-htc-wildfire-s-android-412-aokp-jelly-bean-custom-rom/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android 4.1.2 AOKP Jelly Bean Custom ROM</a> and <a href=\"http://a.ndroid.pro/2012/09/htc-wildfire-s%D9%96fed-up-of-the-low-internal-memory-make-a-new-large-room/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data2SD</a> like discribed in the linked articles. But I was stuck the device was not booting until I removed Data2SD. The AOKP-ROM was working pretty well and stable, but installing Data2SD simply did not work in combination with Jelly Bean (SD-card formatting: 11 GB FAT23, 4GB ext4 and 256 MB Swap).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I tried to go for the <strong>link2sd</strong> approach. I reformatted my SD-card (14 GB FAT32 and 2GB ext4) and installed Link2SD on my phone as <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1432459\" rel=\"nofollow\">described here</a>. I was able to move additional data and apps to my SD-card and could link some apps to the card.</p>\n\n<p>And now after some days playing around with all that usefull tipps from the internet, for example this thread: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/2065/29916\">What can I do to manage my phone&#39;s internal storage?</a> - <strong>I am at the point where I started</strong>.
