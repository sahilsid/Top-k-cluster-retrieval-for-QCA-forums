I have been reading around about it all week and still don't understand a few things. I though that the encryption was like blackberry encryption, where you put the password in every time you turn the phone on to the screen lock. After a bit of reading, I understand that the \"decryption\" is only done at boot up by putting the password in once. After that, you have to put the same password in at the screen lock simply because of a limitation of Android not allowing two different passwords. I do know that there are new ways to use a different password on the screen lock, and even a pattern lock, that's not my issue. </p>\n\n<p>Here are my questions....</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the device is technically decrypted after boot up, is the screen lock the only security on the phone once it's turned on? </li>\n<li>Does the screen lock of an encrypted device have any stronger security than that of an unencrypted device? If not, it seems like the phone is just as vulnerable to data theft as an unencrypted device if someone steals it while it is turned on.  I understand that it will encrypt again if they turn it off, but if it's on, what good is encryption?  </li>\n<li>If someone pulls the SD card out (which is encrypted) they can't read it with a card reader, but if they put it back in the phone while it's still on, won't the decrypted phone just mount it again so they can read it from the phone?</li>\n<li>Finally, on a Blackberry, a wipe is performed by erasing the encryption key. This makes an almost instant wipe of the whole phone and sd card. I know an encrypted device has to be wiped the same as an unencrypted device, but is Android programmed in a way that the encryption ket is wiped first, in case someone pulls a battery or forces a phone off during a wipe?

And, therefore, it likely has unique environmental issues. So thank you for not immediately telling me to go to ServerFault or SuperUser...</p>\n\n<p><strong>After installing Terminal-IDE,</strong> I read all the help and set about taking advantage of the SSH tools - I really want to get logged in from another system so I have a full keyboard and can treat the phone just like any other networked system. However, I got stopped in my tracks pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I have several routing issues, but I'll put them all here in thinking they may well be related and one place is better than several for finding answers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm using WiFi</strong> to get to/from the phone and, using my <strong>possibly lame Netgear WN802T WiFi</strong> unit (that doesn't have a DHCP server and requires another system to do that). The phone (and other devices) links up, gets an IP address, and surfs the internet from there just fine. I told the DHCP server to <strong>match up the MAC address and give a fixed IP</strong> - this way I avoid the \"single IP for all interfaces when \"fixed IP\" is chosen\" problems identified elsewhere on this site. I have confirmed that IP is indeed given to the phone.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>I set up the sshd service</strong> as found in <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/terminal-ide/downloads/detail?name=Terminal_IDE_Help.pdf&amp;can=2&amp;q=\" rel=\"nofollow\">the official Help PDF.</a> It runs. But no inbound connections succeed; they always end with \"Connection timed out\" (notably NOT \"no route to host\" - which is what I get when I ask for a non-existent IP). That tells me it MAY be actually getting to the port on the phone but nobody's answering! This leads to to immediate questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a way to log inbound attempts?</li>\n<li>Is there a \"firewall\" of some kind?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When I connect out-bound,</strong> it ONLY connects either on the wilds of the internet, OR on the default gateway the DHCP server told it about. It won't connect to ANY \"non-routing IPs\", even though other devices on the same WiFi will (so clearly the WiFi is routing to the local subnet just fine).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do I have to create a route specifically pointing to the internal router (the netgear box)? Or;</p></li>\n<li><p>tell the real outbound router how to route internally as well as externally?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks</strong> for any insights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT TO SHARE MORE DATA</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I have continued to work the problem, and after many hours of frustration, I hooked up a USB cable to the phone and used \"internet passthrough\" to connect to a lap-top which itself is connected via the same wifi. Now I have more data.</p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>connection via the laptop to the rest of the network is stable</li>\n<li>connection to the phone from the laptop succeed in getting through authentication and, after discovering and fixing a minor typo in the sshd script, it works fine.</li>\n<li>connection from the phone, through the cable to the laptop then has full access to the local internal network via IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, this strongly implicates that there are some issues with the phone's end of the WiFi and NOT with the WiFi itself, however, there's not quite enough data to say that since I haven't got sshd running on the laptop to know it is accepting connections through the net... Interestingly, it is not rejecting connection attempts out of hand - they take a long time to drop! (It's a Windows 7 laptop and, frankly, I don't really know how to tell it to open up specific ports - or how to forward to the phone!)</p>\n\n<p>Note also that the only system that can connect to the phone via the wired connection is the laptop that the phone is wired to; so far I have been unable to find a way to get to the phone <em>through</em> the laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for any insight.</p>\n","viewcount":437,"dups":[],"title":"Terminal-IDE / wifi routing issues","tags":["wi-fi","terminal"],"userid":"15011","related":["42867"],"score":1,"answers":["43340"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-04-02T18:44:33.670","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"29868":{"body":"<p>I've started getting a loud beep notification when my battery hits 15%.

It makes a beep to say it's charging, but the computer can't find it.  I think this is because there's a prompt that I have to click to \"appear as a media device\", but of course I can't click any prompt because I have no way of inputting on the phone (is there a way to force input to the phone via computer?).  The weird thing is, before the throwing of the phone onto the ground, I remember the phone mounting IMMEDIATELY when plugged in.  Maybe I changed the default back to \"do not appear as media device\" or whatever accidentally.  The only other possibility, is that the hard hit on the ground somehow physically hurt the usb port so it only charges but doesn't recognize computer (Unlikely correct?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Solutions:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I heard that I could use ADB for this somehow.  But ADB couldn't see that my phone was attached since it doesn't mount.</li>\n<li>I heard there's some BIOS-like screen that I may be able to enable ADB debug from, and I can input via the volume buttons.  Will this help and how do I reach this screen without a factory reset and losing my data?</li>\n<li>I could pay $180 plus labor to get a new screen, and either boom just have a new working phone or then be able to access the suspected media device prompt and move my data off of it.  I am worried though that since it was thrown so hard (happened during a fight) maybe even the motherboard connector was damaged.</li>\n<li>My brother has a Moto X too.  I could follow the iFixit guide and either put his screen on my motherboard, or connect my motherboard to his screen temporarily to see whats happening and answer the prompt (whichever option risk me bricking either phone less).  Downside: it's a pretty complicated process and I imagine there are so many different steps where I could break the phones.</li>\n<li>Physically remove whatever chip holds the flash storage, give this to some professional with a machine who can just read off all the bits and give me my data back.
