I have been researching on Google and XDA for months trying to find a solution. From what I have read, this is my current assumption: Tablets in the USA are not built with phone functionality on purpose to deter people from buying a tablet and using it as their primary phone.</p>\n\n<p>It seems no big deal just learn how to hack to enable phone functions and that would activate the proper Bluetooth headset profiles to work with the external mic on a Bluetooth unit. So after a ton of research I have successfully unlocked, rooted and installed TWRP as well as edited the <code>bool.xml</code> in <code>framework-res.apk</code> to make the Nexus 7 voice capable. But still I have no external Bluetooth mic support.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a problem with Android in general? or Jelly Bean in general? or all tablets?</p>\n\n<p>At this point I have exhausted all that I can do on my own without asking for help. Does anyone know how to use an external Bluetooth mic on the Nexus 7 3g 4.2.1?</p>\n\n<h3>2) My second problem is the tablet will not consistently reconnect with the Bluetooth head unit every time the vehicle starts.</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes it connects properly with phone and media profiles; sometimes just one of the two, and sometimes none at all. I have used the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tasker</a> app as well as the Bluetooth auto connect plugin, but it still is very flaky at best.</p>\n\n<p>I have never owned an Android device before this tablet, always Apple stuff that to be honest just worked right out of the box. But I love the customization available on Android especially for an in-car install. So again is this an Android issue, Nexus issue, or a tablet issue? It seems from the research I have done that most Android phones will auto-connect but these tablets seem to be missing certain Bluetooth settings or profiles that cause them not to work. So any ideas on how to solve this issue?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>At this point, if I can not resolve these two issues, I am going to return the Nexus 7 3G and get a Samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 3G P3100.

I am new to Android and recently bought Huawei Ideos X5 (Android 2.2.1). I haven't found anyone else having this problem. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My Android phone will be able to connect to my wireless network, get an IP address from my DHCP server, but when trying to reach anything over the network it won't work. Although it will work <em>sometimes</em> (i.e. some data will get through). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Debugging:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My Android phone is able to connect and use other wireless networks, although I have only tried two (at my university and at a friend). This would indicate that my phone is not broken. </p>\n\n<p>With closer inspection with the Terminal Emulator App when I ping my server I will get a 80% packet loss ratio. This of course makes it impossible to use the wireless network, but it means some packets do get through (even to the Internet) so it is not a DNS problem. </p>\n\n<p>My laptop can connect and use my wireless network flawlessly (in fact, it can download from Internet at 18 Mbps and upload at 10 Mbps with 802.11g, which I presume is good). My USB wireless adapter works well with it as well. One of my friend's Android phone (LG Optimus One) and iPod works with my wireless network as well, and most strangely, another friend's Android phone who have the very same model (Huawei Ideos X5) works with my wireless network. This would indicate that my access point is not faulty. </p>\n\n<p>There are tons of wireless networks in my area. My phone can see 21 including my own. I have no idea whether this can affect anything. I cannot try any of these because they are protected.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that I do not have your average wireless network setup. I have a server (stationary computer) that runs DHCP server, and so on. Only recently I added wireless network to my apartment by buying D-Link DIR-300 and flashing it with DD-WRT. I have no idea if it worked or not with the original firmware. The router acts as an access point. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to change channel, protocol (B, G, N) , security settings from open to encrypted (WPA2 AES), etc. on the AP to no avail. </p>\n\n<p>Even if the phone is just a few centimeters away from the AP it will still have a 80% packet loss. DD-WRT reports 92-98% signal strength. I think there is a software/setting problem and not a hardware one. </p>\n\n<p>And of course, I have tried to both reset my AP and my phone. Neither helped. Android phone's WiFi does not work when the router is using the factory default or AP settings. I am however concerned that some faulty settings for my wireless network are stored on the phone and it seems they might be synchronized to my Google account, and possibly they might still be there even after I \"forget\" my wireless network or reset the phone (is there a way to be sure everything is wiped?). </p>\n\n<p>At this point, I am out of ideas. I hope I explained my situation sufficiently. Do you have any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I have done some further testing. I reset the DD-WRT router once again to see if it would work and per Ryan's suggestion try to strip it down to the most basic setup. It did not work even if I tried only b/g mode. Interestingly enough the first two seconds of pinging after changing mode works without any packet loss but after that, it will go back to bad again. </p>\n\n<p>I also tried something I wouldn't believe would work -- flashing the original firmware back. To my surprise it did work and my phone doesn't have any packet loss when pinging. (I actually missed that the original firmware <em>does</em> support AP mode). However, I still cannot understand why it didn't work in DD-WRT and would be very interested in any possible explanation. </p>\n\n<p>As stubborn as I am, I might try to flash back to DD-WRT again tomorrow to see if it works (if it does, I cannot explain why! Blaming it on bad flash seems naïve in my opinion). </p>\n","viewcount":2566,"dups":[],"title":"WiFi high packet loss at home network","tags":["wi-fi","2.2-froyo","connection-issues","huawei-u8800"],"userid":"4347","related":[],"score":17,"answers":["24284","23038","12364"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-04-14T08:18:47.913","favoritecount":1,"comments":["9836","9912","16278","16280"]},"44821":{"body":"<p>Even I have seen duplicated thread as in: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/35847/cannot-unlock-tablet-as-have-no-internet-connection\">Cannot unlock tablet as have no internet connection?</a></p>\n\n<p>But Here's my situation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I have wifi/data turned off. </li>\n<li>I have the developer option turned on and my laptop does recognized the device with usb plugged in.
