Is surely can't work, and the screen turn off once \"Google\" is shown, so I would like to reflash it back to other image. However, my laptop can't recognize my Nexus S anymore in the bootloader. I can use \"adb shell\" once the device is normally booted (even without screen), but once I type \"adb reboot bootloader\", the connection is lost! Both \"adb and fastboot devices\" show nothing....</p>\n\n<p>There are many threads talking about unable to connect devices but 70% of them are driver-related issue and 30% of them, ex: sudo adb, just don't work for me. I think I am not facing the driver issue because I still can use \"adb shell\" once the device is normally booted (not in bootloader mode). Moreover, I also tried few debrick tools contributed by xda community but with no luck. The most closed thread to this question is: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/58187/adb-can-discover-devices-but-not-fastboot\">ADB can discover devices but not fastboot</a> \nBut it seems there is no answer for this question.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering if there is any way that I can reflash image to my device without accessing it in bootloader mode? (ex: push image in to device via adb shell when device is normally booted?). I am also wondering if there is any way to fix this problem. </p>\n","viewcount":142,"dups":[],"title":"adb/fastboot can't find device in bootloader, but they can do it when booted","tags":["adb","bootloader","fastboot"],"userid":"65255","related":["58187"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-07-05T23:27:56.197","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"75639":{"body":"<p>I have S4 I9515.
