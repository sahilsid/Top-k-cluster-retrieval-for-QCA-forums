So then I thought it was possibly a corrupt ADB, so I went ahead and reinstalled the Android SDK This lead to a few hours wasted, but was feeling confident this would solve my problems. Unfortunately it did not, does anyone have any suggestions? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To add to the confusion, I can get the EVO to mount as a storage device, and upload an <code>apk</code> for development, but this is not very helpful if I have to transfer the file manually every time I want to test. </p>\n","viewcount":48,"dups":[],"title":"HTC EVO 3D not appearing on Mac OSX adb","tags":["adb","htc","mac-os-x","htc-evo-3d"],"userid":"53096","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["66183"],"acceptedanswer":"66183","creationdate":"2014-02-08T03:16:01.510","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"62982":{"body":"<p>ClockworkMod Recovery v6.0.2.3 gives me the folling error when I try to update my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (GT-P5113) to Cyanogenmod 11:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Restarting adbd...\nFinding update package...\nOpening update package...\nInstalling update...\nset_metadata_recursive: some changes failed\nE:Error in /tmp/update.zip\n(status 7)\nInstallation aborted.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Being desperate I tried the same thing with <a href=\"http://techerrata.com/browse/twrp2/p5110\" rel=\"nofollow\">Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP)</a> v2.6.3.0 -- also the latest for my platofrm,</p>\n\n<pre><code>Checking for MD5 file...\nSkipping MD5 check: no MD5 file file found.\nset_metadata_recursive: some changes filed\nE:Error: executing updater binary in zip '/data/media/0/sideload.zip'\n</code></pre>\n","viewcount":25651,"dups":[],"title":"Flashing CM 11, I get `set_metadata_recursive: some changes failed`:","tags":["clockworkmod"],"userid":"7425","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["62989"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-02-08T03:44:11.753","favoritecount":3,"comments":[]},"60639":{"body":"<p>I recently was given a free tablet that is turning out to be more trouble than it is worth.

But is that all? Or could an app equipped with this permission read the entire mail?</li>\n<li><code>com.google.android.gm.permission.WRITE_GMAIL</code>: could an app with this permission write and send mails on my behalf? Or even delete existing mails (including the \"written-and-sent one\", to hide its activities)?</li>\n<li><code>com.google.android.gm.permission.READ_CONTENT_PROVIDER</code>: one app describes its use as \"read Gmail labels and get unread count\". Another one writes \"Used to update the unread email count on your lockscreen. Email content is <em>not</em> sent to our servers.\" Which suggests this permission can be used to access the entire mail content. And other contents?<br>\nIn some source code I found the comment <em>Permission required to access <code>android.content.ContentProvider</code></em>, which suggests a lot of content getting accessible this way if it means <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>THE</em> content provider</a>, including contacts and calendars.
