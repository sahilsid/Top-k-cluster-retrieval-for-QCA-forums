Or could I simply substitute the <code>aboot.mbn</code> and <code>sb*.mbn</code> files from a previous Samsung firmware?  </p>\n\n<p>Also, how could I actually find an old firmware for the Galaxy Note II?

The most similar firmware available on Samsung's site is N7100XXUENC3.  It does not contain the <code>aboot.mbn</code> and <code>sb*.mbn</code> files.  Instead N7100XXUENC3 has <code>sboot.bin tz.img boot.img recovery.img system.img modem.bin cache.img hidden.img</code>.

Unfortunately it did not, does anyone have any suggestions? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To add to the confusion, I can get the EVO to mount as a storage device, and upload an <code>apk</code> for development, but this is not very helpful if I have to transfer the file manually every time I want to test. </p>\n","viewcount":48,"dups":[],"title":"HTC EVO 3D not appearing on Mac OSX adb","tags":["adb","htc","mac-os-x","htc-evo-3d"],"userid":"53096","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["66183"],"acceptedanswer":"66183","creationdate":"2014-02-08T03:16:01.510","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"62982":{"body":"<p>ClockworkMod Recovery v6.0.2.3 gives me the folling error when I try to update my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (GT-P5113) to Cyanogenmod 11:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Restarting adbd...\nFinding update package...\nOpening update package...\nInstalling update...\nset_metadata_recursive: some changes failed\nE:Error in /tmp/update.zip\n(status 7)\nInstallation aborted.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Being desperate I tried the same thing with <a href=\"http://techerrata.com/browse/twrp2/p5110\" rel=\"nofollow\">Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP)</a> v2.6.3.0 -- also the latest for my platofrm,</p>\n\n<pre><code>Checking for MD5 file...\nSkipping MD5 check: no MD5 file file found.\nset_metadata_recursive: some changes filed\nE:Error: executing updater binary in zip '/data/media/0/sideload.zip'\n</code></pre>\n","viewcount":25651,"dups":[],"title":"Flashing CM 11, I get `set_metadata_recursive: some changes failed`:","tags":["clockworkmod"],"userid":"7425","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["62989"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-02-08T03:44:11.753","favoritecount":3,"comments":[]},"60639":{"body":"<p>I recently was given a free tablet that is turning out to be more trouble than it is worth.

But is that all? Or could an app equipped with this permission read the entire mail?</li>\n<li><code>com.google.android.gm.permission.WRITE_GMAIL</code>: could an app with this permission write and send mails on my behalf? Or even delete existing mails (including the \"written-and-sent one\", to hide its activities)?</li>\n<li><code>com.google.android.gm.permission.READ_CONTENT_PROVIDER</code>: one app describes its use as \"read Gmail labels and get unread count\". Another one writes \"Used to update the unread email count on your lockscreen. Email content is <em>not</em> sent to our servers.\" Which suggests this permission can be used to access the entire mail content. And other contents?<br>\nIn some source code I found the comment <em>Permission required to access <code>android.content.ContentProvider</code></em>, which suggests a lot of content getting accessible this way if it means <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>THE</em> content provider</a>, including contacts and calendars.

Strangely, the Kindle is not talking to my Ubuntu PC: when I plug it in, <code>lsusb</code> reports no additional devices and <code>dmesg</code> reports that the device is disconnecting almost immediately:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[450654.465431] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;new high-speed USB device number 14 using ehci_hcd\n[450654.558614] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;New USB device found, idVendor=18d1, idProduct=0100\n[450654.558622] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;New USB device strings: Mfr=5, Product=1, SerialNumber=2\n[450654.558627] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;Product: kindle\n[450654.558631] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;Manufacturer: Amazon\n[450654.558634] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;SerialNumber: 0123456789ABCDEF\n[450657.586116] usb 1-4.7.2: &gt;USB disconnect, device number 14\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm at a loss for how to diagnose this further. The <code>fk</code>/<code>FireKit</code> tools can access the device but only while it's booting up, and despite using fk to reflash TWRP I have noticed no improvement. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As my answer indicates, I solved the problem by unbricking the Kindle with a different computer. <strong>This shouldn't have helped.</strong> I'm still very open to any answer that helps to identify the real issue.</p>\n","viewcount":585,"dups":[],"title":"Can't mount first-gen Kindle Fire in TWRP","tags":["unbricking","amazon-kindle-fire","twrp"],"userid":"42187","related":[],"score":3,"answers":["54095"],"acceptedanswer":"54095","creationdate":"2013-09-26T18:51:40.763","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"2429":{"body":"<p>I have ripped my library of DVDs to my home server.

I have been researching on Google and XDA for months trying to find a solution. From what I have read, this is my current assumption: Tablets in the USA are not built with phone functionality on purpose to deter people from buying a tablet and using it as their primary phone.</p>\n\n<p>It seems no big deal just learn how to hack to enable phone functions and that would activate the proper Bluetooth headset profiles to work with the external mic on a Bluetooth unit. So after a ton of research I have successfully unlocked, rooted and installed TWRP as well as edited the <code>bool.xml</code> in <code>framework-res.apk</code> to make the Nexus 7 voice capable. But still I have no external Bluetooth mic support.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a problem with Android in general? or Jelly Bean in general? or all tablets?</p>\n\n<p>At this point I have exhausted all that I can do on my own without asking for help. Does anyone know how to use an external Bluetooth mic on the Nexus 7 3g 4.2.1?</p>\n\n<h3>2) My second problem is the tablet will not consistently reconnect with the Bluetooth head unit every time the vehicle starts.</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes it connects properly with phone and media profiles; sometimes just one of the two, and sometimes none at all. I have used the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tasker</a> app as well as the Bluetooth auto connect plugin, but it still is very flaky at best.</p>\n\n<p>I have never owned an Android device before this tablet, always Apple stuff that to be honest just worked right out of the box. But I love the customization available on Android especially for an in-car install. So again is this an Android issue, Nexus issue, or a tablet issue? It seems from the research I have done that most Android phones will auto-connect but these tablets seem to be missing certain Bluetooth settings or profiles that cause them not to work. So any ideas on how to solve this issue?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>At this point, if I can not resolve these two issues, I am going to return the Nexus 7 3G and get a Samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 3G P3100.

I am new to Android and recently bought Huawei Ideos X5 (Android 2.2.1). I haven't found anyone else having this problem. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My Android phone will be able to connect to my wireless network, get an IP address from my DHCP server, but when trying to reach anything over the network it won't work. Although it will work <em>sometimes</em> (i.e. some data will get through). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Debugging:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My Android phone is able to connect and use other wireless networks, although I have only tried two (at my university and at a friend). This would indicate that my phone is not broken. </p>\n\n<p>With closer inspection with the Terminal Emulator App when I ping my server I will get a 80% packet loss ratio. This of course makes it impossible to use the wireless network, but it means some packets do get through (even to the Internet) so it is not a DNS problem. </p>\n\n<p>My laptop can connect and use my wireless network flawlessly (in fact, it can download from Internet at 18 Mbps and upload at 10 Mbps with 802.11g, which I presume is good). My USB wireless adapter works well with it as well. One of my friend's Android phone (LG Optimus One) and iPod works with my wireless network as well, and most strangely, another friend's Android phone who have the very same model (Huawei Ideos X5) works with my wireless network. This would indicate that my access point is not faulty. </p>\n\n<p>There are tons of wireless networks in my area. My phone can see 21 including my own. I have no idea whether this can affect anything. I cannot try any of these because they are protected.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that I do not have your average wireless network setup. I have a server (stationary computer) that runs DHCP server, and so on. Only recently I added wireless network to my apartment by buying D-Link DIR-300 and flashing it with DD-WRT. I have no idea if it worked or not with the original firmware. The router acts as an access point. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to change channel, protocol (B, G, N) , security settings from open to encrypted (WPA2 AES), etc. on the AP to no avail. </p>\n\n<p>Even if the phone is just a few centimeters away from the AP it will still have a 80% packet loss. DD-WRT reports 92-98% signal strength. I think there is a software/setting problem and not a hardware one. </p>\n\n<p>And of course, I have tried to both reset my AP and my phone. Neither helped. Android phone's WiFi does not work when the router is using the factory default or AP settings. I am however concerned that some faulty settings for my wireless network are stored on the phone and it seems they might be synchronized to my Google account, and possibly they might still be there even after I \"forget\" my wireless network or reset the phone (is there a way to be sure everything is wiped?). </p>\n\n<p>At this point, I am out of ideas. I hope I explained my situation sufficiently. Do you have any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I have done some further testing. I reset the DD-WRT router once again to see if it would work and per Ryan's suggestion try to strip it down to the most basic setup. It did not work even if I tried only b/g mode. Interestingly enough the first two seconds of pinging after changing mode works without any packet loss but after that, it will go back to bad again. </p>\n\n<p>I also tried something I wouldn't believe would work -- flashing the original firmware back. To my surprise it did work and my phone doesn't have any packet loss when pinging. (I actually missed that the original firmware <em>does</em> support AP mode). However, I still cannot understand why it didn't work in DD-WRT and would be very interested in any possible explanation. </p>\n\n<p>As stubborn as I am, I might try to flash back to DD-WRT again tomorrow to see if it works (if it does, I cannot explain why! Blaming it on bad flash seems naïve in my opinion). </p>\n","viewcount":2566,"dups":[],"title":"WiFi high packet loss at home network","tags":["wi-fi","2.2-froyo","connection-issues","huawei-u8800"],"userid":"4347","related":[],"score":17,"answers":["24284","23038","12364"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-04-14T08:18:47.913","favoritecount":1,"comments":["9836","9912","16278","16280"]},"44821":{"body":"<p>Even I have seen duplicated thread as in: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/35847/cannot-unlock-tablet-as-have-no-internet-connection\">Cannot unlock tablet as have no internet connection?</a></p>\n\n<p>But Here's my situation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I have wifi/data turned off. </li>\n<li>I have the developer option turned on and my laptop does recognized the device with usb plugged in.

I have been reading around about it all week and still don't understand a few things. I though that the encryption was like blackberry encryption, where you put the password in every time you turn the phone on to the screen lock. After a bit of reading, I understand that the \"decryption\" is only done at boot up by putting the password in once. After that, you have to put the same password in at the screen lock simply because of a limitation of Android not allowing two different passwords. I do know that there are new ways to use a different password on the screen lock, and even a pattern lock, that's not my issue. </p>\n\n<p>Here are my questions....</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the device is technically decrypted after boot up, is the screen lock the only security on the phone once it's turned on? </li>\n<li>Does the screen lock of an encrypted device have any stronger security than that of an unencrypted device? If not, it seems like the phone is just as vulnerable to data theft as an unencrypted device if someone steals it while it is turned on.  I understand that it will encrypt again if they turn it off, but if it's on, what good is encryption?  </li>\n<li>If someone pulls the SD card out (which is encrypted) they can't read it with a card reader, but if they put it back in the phone while it's still on, won't the decrypted phone just mount it again so they can read it from the phone?</li>\n<li>Finally, on a Blackberry, a wipe is performed by erasing the encryption key. This makes an almost instant wipe of the whole phone and sd card. I know an encrypted device has to be wiped the same as an unencrypted device, but is Android programmed in a way that the encryption ket is wiped first, in case someone pulls a battery or forces a phone off during a wipe?

Aside from reliability and the fact that not everybody wants his private data in the cloud (and even mentioned API reference<sup><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html\">2</a></sup> warns: <em>Android makes no guarantees about the security of your data while using backup.

And, therefore, it likely has unique environmental issues. So thank you for not immediately telling me to go to ServerFault or SuperUser...</p>\n\n<p><strong>After installing Terminal-IDE,</strong> I read all the help and set about taking advantage of the SSH tools - I really want to get logged in from another system so I have a full keyboard and can treat the phone just like any other networked system. However, I got stopped in my tracks pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I have several routing issues, but I'll put them all here in thinking they may well be related and one place is better than several for finding answers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'm using WiFi</strong> to get to/from the phone and, using my <strong>possibly lame Netgear WN802T WiFi</strong> unit (that doesn't have a DHCP server and requires another system to do that). The phone (and other devices) links up, gets an IP address, and surfs the internet from there just fine. I told the DHCP server to <strong>match up the MAC address and give a fixed IP</strong> - this way I avoid the \"single IP for all interfaces when \"fixed IP\" is chosen\" problems identified elsewhere on this site. I have confirmed that IP is indeed given to the phone.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>I set up the sshd service</strong> as found in <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/terminal-ide/downloads/detail?name=Terminal_IDE_Help.pdf&amp;can=2&amp;q=\" rel=\"nofollow\">the official Help PDF.</a> It runs. But no inbound connections succeed; they always end with \"Connection timed out\" (notably NOT \"no route to host\" - which is what I get when I ask for a non-existent IP). That tells me it MAY be actually getting to the port on the phone but nobody's answering! This leads to to immediate questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a way to log inbound attempts?</li>\n<li>Is there a \"firewall\" of some kind?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>When I connect out-bound,</strong> it ONLY connects either on the wilds of the internet, OR on the default gateway the DHCP server told it about. It won't connect to ANY \"non-routing IPs\", even though other devices on the same WiFi will (so clearly the WiFi is routing to the local subnet just fine).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do I have to create a route specifically pointing to the internal router (the netgear box)? Or;</p></li>\n<li><p>tell the real outbound router how to route internally as well as externally?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks</strong> for any insights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT TO SHARE MORE DATA</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I have continued to work the problem, and after many hours of frustration, I hooked up a USB cable to the phone and used \"internet passthrough\" to connect to a lap-top which itself is connected via the same wifi. Now I have more data.</p>\n\n<p>I have confirmed the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>connection via the laptop to the rest of the network is stable</li>\n<li>connection to the phone from the laptop succeed in getting through authentication and, after discovering and fixing a minor typo in the sshd script, it works fine.</li>\n<li>connection from the phone, through the cable to the laptop then has full access to the local internal network via IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, this strongly implicates that there are some issues with the phone's end of the WiFi and NOT with the WiFi itself, however, there's not quite enough data to say that since I haven't got sshd running on the laptop to know it is accepting connections through the net... Interestingly, it is not rejecting connection attempts out of hand - they take a long time to drop! (It's a Windows 7 laptop and, frankly, I don't really know how to tell it to open up specific ports - or how to forward to the phone!)</p>\n\n<p>Note also that the only system that can connect to the phone via the wired connection is the laptop that the phone is wired to; so far I have been unable to find a way to get to the phone <em>through</em> the laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for any insight.</p>\n","viewcount":437,"dups":[],"title":"Terminal-IDE / wifi routing issues","tags":["wi-fi","terminal"],"userid":"15011","related":["42867"],"score":1,"answers":["43340"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-04-02T18:44:33.670","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"29868":{"body":"<p>I've started getting a loud beep notification when my battery hits 15%.

On some websites, it impossible to type a full sentence. Does not matter if I use the factory keyboard, or SwiftKey.</li>\n<li>It's essentially impossible to listen to music and browse the web at the same time. One of the applications gets killed after a short while.</li>\n<li>Sometimes can't even text and listen to music at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since my old Sony Ericsson cellphone could handle all of these without any problem ever, with one quarter of this memory, or so, I think either something is wrong with my phone, or it's firmware is totally unusable. I lean towards the second one, since my girlfriend's Sony phone has the same issues. And also, I don't think it's a hardware problem, since other applications run totally smoothly and with zero problem. NewsBlur and Calendar works perfectly, and I've tried installing some performance-hungry games, all of them run perfectly fine and smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>I tried many things. Factory reset did not help, disabling 90% of all applications did not help, trying different keyboard software, music player, browser did not help much. I removed all the applications that I don't use on a daily basis, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If I use a lightweight homescreen instead of the factory one, and switch to Dolphin browser or Opera Mini, things get a <em>little</em> better, but each problem happens on a daily basis anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have up-to-date firmware and applications.</p>\n\n<p>What annoying is that Android seems to keep applications cached like homescreen, Play Store, etc. It's great that homescreen loads instantly, but I don't mind it killed, if that's required to keep keyboard in memory (while I'm typing, at least!)</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong? Is this normal? (It should not be...) Should I send a warranty claim?</p>\n\n<p>I think it should work for so simple tasks out of the box, but I'm open to anything that helps. Unfortunately, on Google and Sony support forums I could not find anything aside clearing application data and using less applications. I already use less applications that I've used on my non-smartphone, and clearing application data did only rarefied the issues very little, and then everything went back to \"normal\", after a day or so.</p>\n\n<p>So clearing application data does not really solve the problem. Also, I don't want useful information to be lost, so I think clearing application data regularly is not an option. For me, it seems that factory applications are so poorly designed, that they prefer loading huge amount of unimportant information to RAM, and killing really important applications to make space for it. And there is always still at least 150-200 megabytes of RAM left, when applications start to get killed...</p>\n","viewcount":100,"dups":[],"title":"My phone handles RAM utterly wrong","tags":["keyboard","ram","warranty"],"userid":"57419","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-03-31T09:39:16.513","favoritecount":0,"comments":["89963","89964","90025"]},"66576":{"body":"<p>I know we can use the teamviewer app to connect to PC using internet connection for remote desktop connection.</p>\n\n<p>But I want to know if it is possible to connect the PC with Phone using the Wifi connection.

And I have downloaded and installed Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>Normally when I take pictures on the stock Camera app, my photos gets sent to <strong>sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO</strong>. However, when I installed Instagram and started to use it, I notice that it created a new folder under <strong>sdcard/DCIM</strong> and called it <strong>Camera</strong> and that is where it places the pictures I take inside the app. What's worse is that, aside from creating the <strong>sdcard/DCIM/Camera</strong> folder, it also creates the same image inside <strong>sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO</strong>. So whenever I take an Instagram photo, that picture gets 2 copies plus the third one with the applied filters on a separate folder called <strong>Instagram</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This may not have been an issue because I can always clear the <strong>sdcard/DCIM/Camera</strong> folder every after some time.

I am looking for ideas as to what to try next.</p>\n\n<p>The phone has been obtained from eBay and seems to be of no-name Chinese manufacture. It has 2GB of RAM and a 4-core CPU. It has three SIM ports, two cameras, a 2800 mAh battery, and all the usual wifi/bluetooth/GPS/gyro interfaces. The screen is approximately 6 x 2.5\" in size and supports full HD. It is running Android 4.2.1 (I believe this is Jelly Bean).</p>\n\n<p>I am told that the rear camera used to work, but now no longer does - I am wondering whether my friend received an Android update via her provider, which stopped it working. The front camera seems to work, although (since I am not used to large-screen devices) it seems to be permanently auto-focusing and clicking every few seconds. I don't know whether this is a feature or a fault!</p>\n\n<p>Having done some research, I believe a \"swirl\" arrows icon should appear superimposed on any live camera image to toggle between camera devices, but I cannot see this anywhere. I have tried the following apps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Camera (stock app) - front camera works fine, no way to switch to rear camera</li>\n<li>HD Camera Ultra - crashes</li>\n<li>Camera (downloaded) - only front camera</li>\n<li>Dual Camera / Double Shot - crashes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of the crashy apps seem to have a lot of Play reviews, so I am minded to think there is a problem on my device specifically, rather than just that these apps are of low quality.</p>\n\n<p>I notice that if I put Camera (the non-stock version) into Panorama mode, it tries to connect to the rear camera, whereas for movie and pictures it uses the front camera. However it seems to fail to connect to the rear camera:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Camera error</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Can't connect to the camera.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect this is a good sign - it is perhaps \"half connected\"!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I wondered if it just needed a factory reset, so I have done one, taking it back to \"here's a demo of your device\" state. However this hasn't made any difference.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts on the reasons why I cannot get this to work:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The rear camera has developed a hardware fault</li>\n<li>The whole phone is fussy about what version of Android it uses and/or &mdash; given that it is unbranded &mdash; has not been tested as well as it should have been</li>\n<li>The front camera is stuck repeatedly auto-focusing and as a result does not give the rear camera an opportunity to initialise (update: I don't think this is the case now; if I hold the phone far enough away, and focus on something in good light, the focus box goes green and the front camera stops auto-focusing)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few things that might be worth a try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Find a test (camera) app to give me techie info about the devices the phone can detect.

This might bring the camera back to life, but possibly it may be overwritten when my friend puts her SIM back in</li>\n<li>Upgrade Android the approved way. Using my SIM I have searched the Play store for \"upgrade Android\" but cannot find anything useful. I believe (from material on the web) there should be an upgrade option in \"About this phone\" but I don't seem to have that</li>\n<li>Root the phone and try a later minor version</li>\n<li>Root the phone and try a later major version</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I haven't asked whether my friend would mind me rooting the phone, but I am given to believe it is safe these days.

I carry the phone from home, to work, and back. It is set up to connect to the WAPs in both locations. There is a chronic problem where upon returning home many of the applications lose network connectivity as soon as the phone connects to the WAP at home. The ONLY way I have found, so far, to fix this is shut the phone down and restart. The partial list is CSipSimple, S.MS, TouchDown email, which all do \"run at startup\"; but so does Facebook and there is no issue with that. After leaving work, all of these application continue to work on the Wireless Carrier until I arrive home. Turn off WiFi and they start working again, turn on WiFi and they die. I have never had the reverse problem, where they work at home but die when I get to work.</p>\n\n<p>The work subnet is 10.1.0.0/16. The home subnet is 192.16.2.0/24.</p>\n\n<p>A network trace shows the phone begins ARP broadcasts looking for the work default gateway as soon as it authenticates with the home WAP, which of course are never answered.

Clearly some specific applications have held on to the work gateway, and who knows what else, so I'm boggled right there because where I come from the gateway is in the network stack and can't possibly behave in an application specific way, but then this is Android, which is a framework, and its behaving like applications can independently own their own copy of an abstracted interface.</p>\n\n<p>Any hard core Android internals guys out there have any clue?</p>\n","viewcount":46,"dups":[],"title":"Cached gateway?
