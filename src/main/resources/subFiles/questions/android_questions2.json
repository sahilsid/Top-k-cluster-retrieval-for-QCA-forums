As the name suggests, it uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">APT</a> style repositories, which I'm used to from Linux (Debian and derivates). It even lets you have your own private repo to share apps between devices (or with friends). All apps are offered for free, so no need for a \"license server\". But <strong>how safe is it for the end-user?</strong> I've googled (and ducked) for hours, but could not find any source on this. Instead I found a lot of links of the type \"get paid apps for free\", \"black market\", and other piracy-oriented stuff – which is definitely not what I'm after. I'm more than open to pay for good apps<sup>5</sup>, so \"getting them for free\" is not the intention behind my question. Like <em>F-Droid</em>, <em>Aptoide</em> has multiple repositories – but I couldn't figure out whether there's a \"trust-able\" main repository like with <em>F-Droid</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There is related information available in the package description (e.g. <a href=\"http://webservices.aptoide.com/webservices/2/getApkInfo/package%3anet.wigle.wigleandroid\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide package info for Wigle Wifi Wardriving\">this one</a>) indicating safety measures such as malware scan, signature validation, and third-party-validation. But as the <a href=\"http://m.hidiho.store.aptoide.com/app/market/net.wigle.wigleandroid/58/4837328/Wigle%20Wifi%20Wardriving\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide page for Wigle Wifi Wardriving\">corresponding web page</a> shows, this information seems to be at least partly relying on user feedback (which could be faked/manipulated), or is not even presented to the user (the package info e.g. names 3 scanners used to check, I cannot find this info on the web page). While I might be able to look things up via package info, I cannot ask e.g. my 70+ years old parents to do so. On <a href=\"http://m.aptoide.com/1000contest\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide Trusted $1.000 Contest\">this page</a>, <em>Aptoide</em> also points out how to see results of their security measures, and explicitly states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aptoide Anti-Malware platform analyses applications in run-time and disables potential threats <strong>across all stores.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Emphasis mine) – which suggests a malware protection comparable to that of <em>Google Play</em> (how does that go together with those \"black market rumors\"? Maybe they just don't <em>remove</em> offending apps, but only <em>mark</em> them instead?).</p>\n\n<p>So finally</p>\n\n<h2>The question:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a way to safely use <em>Aptoide</em> as source for apps? If so, how?<sup>6</sup> If not, why not?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bonus points for an \"idiot proof\" way which could be recommended to less experienced users.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n\n<p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I know it would be possible opening the <em>Google Play Store</em> web page of the app, scroll through it, and click the corresponding link when found – but you can't call that user-friendly, or expect users doing this on every update.<br>\n<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> e.g. on first install it requested the \"unsuspecting\" <code>READ_PHONE_STATE</code> with the usual justification. With an update, it could request <code>CALL_PHONE</code>, <code>PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS</code>, and others – and the Play app would not bring that up, as they belong to the \"same group\".<br>\n<strong><sup>3</sup></strong> To figure \"new permissions\", one had to compare those of the installed version with those of the present one. Have fun!<br>\n<strong><sup>4</sup></strong> I've just edited two answers and added some details on <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/posts/217/edit\">AppBrain</a> and <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/posts/7496/edit\">F-Droid</a> to fill those gaps<br>\n<strong><sup>5</sup></strong> I've bought a lot of apps on <em>Google Play</em> (or donated to the dev directly), and e.g. <em>F-Droid</em> has donation buttons on each app's page to make this possible<br>\n<strong><sup>6</sup></strong> I could imagine by knowing (and restricting your use to) \"safe Aptoide repositories\" this could be achieved. But as I wrote, I couldn't figure out which ones to consider \"safe\". The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptoide\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wikipedia: Aptoide\">Aptoide article on Wikipedia</a> suggests there's a \"default repo\" on install, and more repos need to be added manually; so it might be sticking to that first one is safe.</p>\n","viewcount":3431,"dups":[],"title":"How safe is it to use Aptoide?","tags":["alternative-markets"],"userid":"16575","related":["216","216"],"score":4,"answers":["74813"],"acceptedanswer":"74813","creationdate":"2014-06-21T19:03:59.393","favoritecount":1,"comments":["97478","97483","97551"]},"74617":{"body":"<p>I have a Kobo Arc 10HD and it runs on Android 4.2.2.

Knowing I like to tinker with these things, she offered me the phone in whatever condition I can muster from it. </p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, she dropped it into some water and from that point on, the android OS will no longer boot. The bootloader screen comes up when powered on (without forcing this mode using the hardware volume buttons), but that's as far as it goes. I don't believe this is a boot-loop, as the phone does not automatically reset itself, but I'm somewhat new to the terminology. I don't believe this question is quite a duplicate of <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/49608/38101\">this one</a>, as the screens I am able to access are different.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a <code>DROID X</code> (<a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/48462/38101\">similar question for this model</a>), but for those unfamiliar, the bootloader presented using the volume-button-on-boot method does not produce the same screen. on the <code>X</code>, there are actual options, such as loading fastboot, etc. With the <code>2/R2-D2</code>, there are no options, just \"OK to program\". I am not sure if the bootloader is unlocked or not. The working D2 is in stock condition, and the bootloader menu is minimal as compared to that of the X, and the non-working bootloader is identical. If the stock condition is locked, then I assume that this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>I can force recovery mode (holding the keyboard 'x' while booting), but the options there do not help.</p>\n\n<p>From the bootloader screen, this is what I see:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Always this header</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Bootloader\nD2.37\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if battery is charged</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Battery OK\nOK to Program\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if battery is depleted</em> (I think, the batt's full at the moment and my memory may be off):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Battery low\nUnable to program\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if no USB connected</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Connect USB\nData Cable\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if USB connected (to PC or straight power)</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Transfer Mode:\nUSB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the recovery screen (after loading the <code>!</code> image and getting to the actual menu by pressing both the volume up and down buttons at the same time), this is what I see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Android system recovery &lt;3e&gt;\n\nAndroid system recovery utility\n\nreboot system now\napply update from sdcard\nwipe data/factory reset\nwipe cache partition\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of the above options, I have tried all, but I know the sdcard option was done incorrectly, as I am not sure which files are required for this update. The other options, which 'worked' resulted in no change in the boot behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The phone is detected by my Windows 7 machine. i.e. When I plug the device into the PC, Windows detects the hardware and recognizes the R2-D2 as being the same (no new drivers required) as the Droid 2, and I can see it in my list of devices in My Computer.\nHowever, I can't run any debug functions on it. i.e. The D2 (essentially the same phone, same hardware, drivers, etc.) that I regularly connect to my PC to test my own programmed apps, and ADB works flawlessly. Any attempt to debug the device results in the device not being found by adb. While in either the bootloader or in Recovery Mode, the R2-D2 cannot be detected by <code>adb devices</code>. If I plug in the functional D2, adb immediately is able to display the device ID.</p>\n\n<p>Also tried to see if <code>fastboot</code> would detect the device, but it did neither at the bootloader, nor in recovery mode.</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded a series of <code>.sbf</code> files from various sources (<a href=\"http://sbf.droid-developers.org/cdma_droid2/list.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> being the only one I can find at the moment), and reflashed using RSDLite. I am new to this and so I used numerous walkthroughs from the web to get me this far. I am somewhat confident that I've learned how to flash properly, since some of the attempts failed and caused the bootloader to fail, but a few of them at least got me back to the same 'working' condition the phone was in when I picked it up.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I don't care if the phone is rooted or not; I don't care if I have a custom or stock ROM loaded; I don't care if the OS is buggy once running. I would just like to be able to get the phone to boot at all. The original owner has since picked up a replacement from Verizon, so worst-case scenario (the phone is a brick) is not the end of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Especially given the fact that I have a nearly identical phone to work with, is there some way I can rip the <code>.img</code>s from the working model and load it onto the broken one? Is there a step in the <code>.sbf</code> reload that I could be doing incorrectly?

Or is there another way to escape this crash/reboot loop?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (2013-02-14):</strong></p>\n\n<p>To be clear, let me elaborate on what I mean by \"crash/reboot loop\" in this case.</p>\n\n<p>When I power on the phone, it goes through its normal display of the Motorola and carrier screens. Then the lock screen begins to load, as it normally does. It seems to me that it takes longer than usual for it to detect a cell signal and identify the carrier network (AT&amp;T), but I can't know for sure.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, if I don't unlock the phone, it will eventually reboot on its own and continue to loop through this process until the battery dies. But if I do unlock the phone, I am immediately greeted by a series of \"Force close\" dialog boxes informing me that the following processes/applications have stopped unexpectedly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>com.motorola.service.main</li>\n<li>Google Partner Setup (com.google.android.partnersetup)</li>\n<li>Google Play Store (com.android.vending)</li>\n<li>Webtop (com.android.portal)</li>\n<li>Bluetooth Share (com.android.bluetooth)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I generally have to select \"Force close\" on the first few in order for the next few to appear, though the Bluetooth one appears immediately on top of the Webtop one. The phone will generally reboot immediately after the Bluetooth error appears. If I have the phone plugged into my computer via USB, I will get a USB connection notification immediately before the phone reboots. I should also note that the com.motorola.service.main error occurs multiple times. (If I \"Force close\" it, it reappears in between the other errors.) The Google Partner Setup and/or Google Play Store errors sometimes appear multiple times, as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT (2013-02-20):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm still having issues, so I thought I'd go through the whole thing again, looking for new information. It turns out I missed one key part about booting into Safe Mode: You have to wait until the boot ANIMATION starts before holding both volume buttons down. (Then you keep holding until a long vibration occurs.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, when I booted into Safe Mode, things got worse, not better. The phone didn't even stay on long enough for it to complete the Android initialization!</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what that means, but maybe it's another clue?</p>\n","viewcount":3688,"dups":[],"title":"How do I escape a crash/reboot loop without losing data?","tags":["2.3-gingerbread","boot-loop","force-close","motorola-atrix-4g"],"userid":"28402","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-02-14T00:31:40.470","favoritecount":0,"comments":["53661","53665","53749","53767","53776","53783","53785","53789","53793","53810","53811","53812","53813","53816","53837","53901","54306","54307","56979","57735","58140"]},"77969":{"body":"<p>Every time I close WhatsApp I get some sort of an advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>According to their <a href=\"http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/general/23014681\" rel=\"nofollow\">site</a> they don't advertise, but I see adverts like this after closing the app:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zTC3F.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zTC3Fm.png\" alt=\"screenshot of advert\"></a></p>\n\n<p><sup>Click image for larger version</sup></p>\n\n<p>I  have contacted the WhatsApp support team and their reply was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WhatsApp does not advertise.

I don't want to update it to any newer version (Y+z) for some reason. Still, the <em>Google Play Store</em> app always lists updates for X, which keeps me from a simple \"update all\". My question, put to a single sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>How to hide updates for X permanently from the \"available updates\" list?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Specific examples</h3>\n\n<p>First, I know there are alternatives as e.g. the <a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/appbrain-app-market/com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.apps\">AppBrain Market App</a>, which can handle this quite well (skip this update, skip all future updates). I prefer a \"generic solution\", which does not depend on a 3<sup>rd</sup> party's market app.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I know that <a href=\"http://www.appbrain.com/app/titanium-backup-%E2%98%85-root/com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\">Titanium Backup</a> includes a \"Market doctor\", which can be used to disconnect an app from <em>Google Play</em>. However, in my specific case that only worked for a few hours: I disconnected <em>GTalk</em>, as I don't want it replaced by <em>Hangouts</em>. The update notification disappeared for a few hours, then it was back. No idea what restored the \"link\".</p>\n\n<p>Third, just to make sure: I'm <em>not</em> talking about the \"auto update\" feature as discussed e.g. in <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/50681/16575\">How to enable Play Store auto-update for just a few apps?</a>. I was rather hoping for something close to <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/35794/16575\">Does the google play store not provide updates for frozen apps?</a>, but without the need to \"freeze\" the app in question (which I still want to use, but in the version installed, not in a \"future version\" available).</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: No, uninstalling the app in question is no option here, though it would perfectly hide any future updates from being displayed :) Nor is \"freezing\", as the app is used regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth: There is a related question for my GTalk example: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/31928/16575\">Do apps included in the gApps zip get updated via Google Play?</a> However, I want the opposite: No update.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It might very well be that \"Google Apps\" (and other pre-installed apps) are handled in some specific way, and restore their \"market links\" themselves somehow. For this case, my question includes: How to prevent that from happening?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Update</h3>\n\n<p>There's a <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2399472\">thread at XDA</a> discussing the very same issue. Until recently, a work-around for \"user installed apps\" was to uninstall them and then sideload the <code>.apk</code> – but even that stopped working. Well, re-signing the <code>.apk</code> with a different key <em>might</em> work for user-apps. But both would fail for pre-installed apps (can't sideload them to override; different signature would refuse that install completely).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there's an <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27431\">issue filed</a> on this by some \"joel.bou..\". Not hard to guess, though blanked out: that would be Joël Bourquard. If it's really him, then that's really an issue (for those who don't know: Joël is the dev behind <em>Titanium Backup</em>). Let me quote from the issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the record: in the Android Market days it was possible to \"Attach\" or \"Detach\" apps (on rooted devices) with a system tool such as Titanium Backup. But nowadays (with the Google Play Store app) this has become nearly impossible to do, because the complete app list seems to sync from Google's servers and the user has no control over that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which explains why detaching with apps like <em>Titanium Backup</em> is no longer permanent. And I'm afraid I've asked the impossible. But I thought the same in the past with other questions, and surprisingly got solutions here. So I do not yet give up hope on this one!</p>\n","viewcount":1664,"dups":[],"title":"How to get rid of update notifications for a given app in Google Play Store?","tags":["google-play-store","update"],"userid":"16575","related":["39180","50681","35794","31928"],"score":9,"answers":["59485"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-30T16:16:01.887","favoritecount":4,"comments":["78742","78744"]},"58026":{"body":"<p>I have a home linux server running the PulseAudio - with shared audio devices, that are connected to cool sound system.</p>\n\n<p>And I have an Android 4.4-based phone.

My first thought was that it was not a good idea. Sometimes you want to keep the original, untouched image, as well as the modified image, maybe for comparison purposes, or to try different filters or settings. In my case I was playing with the curves, and then I saved the image. I wanted to compare the new image with the original, but the original was gone. I decided to go back to the curves settings, and saw that the curves were still as I had set them, which means I can just restore the curve for each channel and that will give me back the original image.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to do a test with another image. I opened a new image, applied a filter from the preset filters, and saved the image. Then I went back to the image, and edited it again, but this time I removed the filter, and the image was back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought was that the gallery image applied non-destructive edits. Something similar to what some editing software does. The one that comes to mind is Shotwell, although this is more of a viewer than and editor, but it has some limited functionality to play around with the saturation, levels, and other settings. It didn't seem likely that the gallery application in adroid was doing that because other image viewing applications showed the image with the filter applied to it.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to connect the device to the computer using a USB cable. I navigated to the camera folder, and opened the image in the computer, and it showed the modified image. This means that the image is being modified. While the devices was still connected to the computer, I decided to remove the filter, and open the image again in the computer. The image was back to original.</p>\n\n<p>How is android able to modify the image file directly, and then restore it to original.

I'm not sure what version of Google Maps, but the Play Store says it's up to date.</em></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I noticed that the G2's battery was draining a lot faster than it had been. I had thought it was just because I had been listening to music a lot more that day, but then when I checked the battery app that night it said that Google Maps was responsible for <em>half</em> the battery drain. I had used it earlier that morning for directions and it had apparently run the GPS in the background for 11 hours straight. I thought it was a one-off, but it happened again today. I've attached a screenshot.</p>\n\n<p>The GPS on my device is <em>off</em> as far as I can tell (i.e. the visual indicator in the tray is dark), so I don't know whether Google Maps is turning it on stealthily and forgetting to turn it off, or whether it's trying to find a GPS signal, can't because the radio is off, and gets stuck in a loop looking for it. I'm assuming the former because there's no CPU activity, just GPS. When I click the \"Location Services\" button, these are the settings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Access to my location: <strong>ON</strong></li>\n<li>GPS Satellites: <strong>OFF</strong></li>\n<li>Wi-Fi &amp; mobile network location: <strong>ON</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So it shouldn't be happening. Why does this happen and how can I fix it? I suppose I can just remember to force stop Google Maps every time I use it, but I'm hoping for a better solution.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nwWEZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zYd90.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></a><br>\n<sup>Screenshot (click for larger variant)</sup></p>\n","viewcount":1843,"dups":[],"title":"Google Maps runs GPS in background even if the GPS radio is off - how do I fix?","tags":["4.2-jelly-bean","battery-life","gps","google-maps","lg-g2"],"userid":"12303","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["57440"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-20T17:26:57.210","favoritecount":0,"comments":["77972","77979","77992","77993","77994","78003","78014","78023"]},"486":{"body":"<p>I'd like my Android device to keep quiet during the night, no alerts for mails and talk messages, only calls and of course, the wake-up alarm.

So far, I've observed the following:</p>\n\n<p>My BIONIC often refuses to get a 3G data connection back when switching from Wi-Fi or 4G back to 3G. If I switch to Airplane Mode and back, sometimes I'll get the 3G connection back, sometimes I won't. In the About Phone -> Status menu, it says the mobile data network is \"connecting.\" Sometimes I end up having to reboot.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, when attempting to use the phone in CDMA-only mode, the phone seems to decide to drop its 3G connection at random and refuse to get it back - even on reboot the phone is slow to acquire signal. I noticed a similar problem on the DROID Charge.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any theory as to why this is happening? Do all Verizon's LTE phones share a common chipset model? Because it sounds to me like whoever makes the chipset is doing a real bang-up job of shipping phones with near-defective radios or radio firmware. As it appears to happen across <strong>three different manufacturers</strong>, the buck falls on Verizon and their LTE chip partner.

This probably happens because the dictionaries include only the lowercase versions of the words, while automatically uppercasing them on demand to save store space or to avoid what they perceive as duplication. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, although lowercase greek vowels may carry an accent, uppercase ones must not do so. More importantly, the 7-bit GSM-ASCII encoding for SMS transmission that allows for 160 characters per SMS only includes uppercase Greek characters without accents (it does not include lowercase ones). As soon as a single lowercase or accented uppercase character is typed, the SMS must be sent using UCS-2 encoding which is 16-bit and limits us to 70 characters per SMS.</p>\n\n<p>The list of characters and their replacements is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ά =&gt; Α\nΈ =&gt; Ε\nΉ =&gt; Η\nΊ =&gt; Ι\nΌ =&gt; Ο\nΎ =&gt; Υ\nΏ =&gt; Ω\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would anyone have any idea how to go about doing this, in an existing app or some sort of macro with string replacement functionality? </p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the long question, if you reached this far. I thought it was important to state the background that lead to this limitation. Thanks in advance.</p>\n","viewcount":900,"dups":[],"title":"When typing, automatically replace specific characters with others (ie accented uppercase Greek vowels)","tags":["sms","keyboard","tasker"],"userid":"4497","related":[],"score":6,"answers":["48884","32107"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-10-19T18:46:27.050","favoritecount":0,"comments":["65753"]},"57772":{"body":"<p>I updated my Nexus 4 to KitKat.

I needed my phone, so I skipped the Wifi setup because my phone just told me it could not verify my software was up to date. I'm on 4.4.4, so I knew it was up to date.</p>\n\n<p>Then, even after logging in to Gmail, Play Store etc., I was unable to get the Google backup restored. Wifi passwords, apps, home screen layout, app settings, that kind of stuff. I suspected that the only possibility to restore a backup is when the phone is first turned on after a reset and I might have lost that opportunity. So I did another factory reset (this time near my Wifi) and voilà, I could login and chose to restore the backup.</p>\n\n<p>BUT: this restore restored what I had installed after the first factory reset. Indeed, the dashboard says this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>No carrier\nLast activity seen on: Sep 1, 2014\nRegistered date: Jul 10, 2014\n\nLGE Nexus 5 o2\nIMEI: xxx\nRegistered date: Sep 3, 2014\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So there's two devices now, one the \"old\" from before the first reset (on Sep 1), and another \"new\" one which was probably created by resetting my phone without restoring the backup (on Sep 1), refreshed by my most recent reset with restoring the backup (on Sep 3).</p>\n\n<p>That was a long intro for a short question: Is there any way to revert my phone to the state stored under that old \"No carrier\" entry? Unfortunately, I have found neither a way to delete one of these backups (for example, the new one) nor a way to even look at the data.</p>\n","viewcount":30,"dups":[],"title":"How to revert phone to state before last-but-one factory reset?","tags":["factory-reset","nexus-5","restore","google-backup"],"userid":"69601","related":["42245"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-09-03T12:37:56.213","favoritecount":1,"comments":["104748","104754","104797","104798"]},"81846":{"body":"<p>i have Micromax unite 2 A106 .my phone memory is almost full .\ni moved some application from my phone memory to external SD, but also getting error some time”phone memory is running out ” i want to uninstall some pre-installed app from my Phone , without making Root .\nplease suggest me …</p>\n","viewcount":52,"dups":["6851"],"title":"uninstall pre-loaded app from Micromax Unite 2 A106","tags":["insufficient-memory","uninstallation","bloatware"],"userid":"72327","related":["6851"],"score":-1,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-09-03T13:19:22.920","favoritecount":0,"comments":["104759","104767","104772"]},"81845":{"body":"<p>My phone doesn't charge until it's switched off.

Typically, I leave the phones plugged in overnight, or else I lose these configurations and I have to redo them.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, when I get in the next morning, some of the lights above the ports on the powered USB hub are off.  The phones connected to these ports are no longer tethered.  In order to resolve this, I have to disconnect the USB cable, reconnect it, re-tether the phone, and redo the configurations.

In the 59µm x 59µm square, it contains only either Blue or Red. In simple words, repeating the 59µm x 59µm square cannot produce this pattern, isn't it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Answer:</h1>\n\n<p>(As it is closed at the moment, I put my answer here.)</p>\n\n<p>I was about to file a query to Samsung Support. To ask better questions, I re-study <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/samsung-galaxy-s5-oled-pixel-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the webpage</a> again, and I came across <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/galaxy-s5-amoled-display-tested-in-the-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> having the table below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gnBG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In the row of \"Sub-Pixels Per Inch\", we can see that only green pixels are having 432 ppi. Both red and blue pixels are at only 305 ppi.</p>\n\n<p>Doing a few maths:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nClosest\\ (inclined)\\ distance\\ between\\ red\\ pixels = \\sqrt{(118µm/2)^2 + (118µm/2)^2} = 83.439 µm\n$$\n$$\n83.439 µm = 0.00328498426 inches\n$$\n$$\nPPI_{red} = PPI_{blue} = \\frac{1}{0.00328498426 inches} = 304.415 ppi \\approx 305 ppi\n$$</p>\n\n<p>This table verifies our PPI calculations and definition. According to these figures, <strong>pixel distance</strong> that is used to calculate the PPI should have been defined as <strong>the closest distance between two dots of the same colour, which can be independently turned on and off</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Is Samsung being tricky? Not exactly.</p>\n\n<p>When I do more researches on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S5\" rel=\"nofollow\">S5</a>, so as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4\" rel=\"nofollow\">S4</a> as they have the same <em>diagonal</em> PenTile RGBG matrix, I got this from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family#PenTile_RGBG\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PenTile RGBG layout used in AMOLED and Plasma displays uses green pixels interleaved with alternating red and blue pixels. The human eye is most sensitive to green, especially for high resolution luminance information. <strong>The green subpixels are mapped to input pixels on a one to one basis. The red and blue subpixels are subsampled, reconstructing the chroma signal at a lower resolution.</strong> The luminance signal is processed using adaptive subpixel rendering filters to optimize reconstruction of high spatial frequencies from the input image, wherein the green subpixels provides the majority of the reconstruction. The red and blue subpixels are capable of reconstructing the horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, but not the highest of the diagonal. Diagonal high spatial frequency information in the red and blue channels of the input image are transferred to the green subpixels for image reconstruction. <strong>Thus the RG-BG scheme creates a color display with one third fewer subpixels than a traditional RGB-RGB scheme but with the same measured luminance display resolution.</strong> This is similar to the Bayer filter commonly used in digital cameras.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, we have a few conclusions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The structure and dimensions in the <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/samsung-galaxy-s5-oled-pixel-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oled-display.net news</a> (it means the image in the question) are correct.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes. S5 AMOLED display does having less than 432 ppi <strong><em>if we focus on red or blue sub-pixels</em></strong>. (They are of 305 ppi only.)</p></li>\n<li><p>However, according to wiki, the perception of resolution depends mainly on the green sub-pixels. So it is having 432 ppi on real-life images. (I believe for pure red and/or blue images, it has only 305 ppi diagonally.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Digital images are displayed at 432 ppi, as they are mapped to the green sub-pixels on 1-to-1 basis. The red and blue sub-pixels are complements.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A side note:</p>\n\n<p>In the last sentence in wiki mentioned our familiar cameras' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bayer filter</a>. After re-studying again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The raw output of Bayer-filter cameras is referred to as a Bayer pattern image. <strong>Since each pixel is filtered to record only one of three colors</strong>, the data from each pixel cannot fully specify each of the red, green, and blue values on its own. To obtain a full-color image, various demosaicing algorithms can be used to interpolate a set of complete red, green, and blue values for each pixel. These algorithms make use of the surrounding pixels of the corresponding colors to estimate the values for a particular pixel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which means the image below is a 8 x 8 pixel sensor (instead of a 4 x 4 or else).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IKXVz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n","viewcount":57,"dups":[],"title":"How large is “one pixel” for S5 AMOLED display?","tags":["screen","samsung-galaxy-s-5","super-amoled"],"userid":"61841","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["71533"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-06-04T09:11:54.633","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"80904":{"body":"<p>I'm trying to use adb backup command, but adb window just pops up and closes instantly, I've tried doing </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>adb backup -all -apk -shared -system -f D:\\backup.ab > D:\\out.txt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but the file is empty, the size is 0 bytes, so I don't even know what went wrong.

Data service is blocked</a> (XDA-Developers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I didn't manually install new applications by the time the problem started occuring.</li>\n<li>As said, I didn't drop or hurt the phone in any way.</li>\n<li>My data plan is having a limit of 1.5GB. I rarely go over 500MB, and the last month was no exception (I am regularly checking the used bandwidth and traffic on the phone).</li>\n<li>The phone is rooted. I am periodically getting BusyBox updates -- I suspect that might be the culprit since it updates a plethora of system files. But I admit that I am no expert in rooting and/or flashing Android phones, and the last sentence might have been an extremely nooby statement. Sorry if that's the case.</li>\n<li>The problem is consistent: with 3G enabled and only using internet from my SIM (again, not through Wi-fi, the problem is not present there). However, there's no fixed period. It varies between 1 and 5 minutes, even though I had 2-3 cases where it worked properly for ~15 mins. I am suspecting that the moment the phone's networking hardware/software goes over a certain load, the problem occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Steps I didn't try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flash a new ROM. Thing is, THL don't have more recent ROMs than the one I got the phone with when buying it off a friend. He downloaded the latest image from THL's website and flashed it, then rooted it. We never tried using unofficial ROMs.</li>\n<li>Flash only the radio software. (I don't have an idea how this could be done, though.)</li>\n<li>Call my mobile provider to ask if my IMEI is blacklisted. Or if they have a malfunctioning cell in the area. (Still though, that can't explain why the problem does occur 6km away in a park as well, so I don't think a malfunctioning tower/cell is to be blamed).</li>\n<li>Go to repair shop for diagnostic/repair of the internal antenna. I would like to leave that as a last resort. From what I hear, this could easily cost $100. And that phone costed me $200. If I have to do this, I might just go and buy a brand new Galaxy S4 as well. Still, I don't want to just throw it away. Obviously, even if I replace it, I'd like to be able to sell it and <em>not</em> burn the guy I sell it to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am out of ideas now. Even though I am by no means an Android expert, I have tried quite a few possible solutions without any effect so far.</p>\n\n<p>Can somebody help with this, please?</p>\n","viewcount":14918,"dups":[],"title":"THL W3 with v4.0.4 - periodically getting \"Restricted Access Changed\" and losing all SIM services","tags":["4.0-ice-cream-sandwich","data-connection","3g","sim-card"],"userid":"44409","related":[],"score":5,"answers":["65692","66067","58945"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-02T13:33:42.783","favoritecount":1,"comments":["75345","75356","75367","75369"]},"2432":{"body":"<p>I need to reinstall my Android ROM but before I would like to backup my Angry Birds savegame/data/scores.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any idea how can I do it?</p>\n","viewcount":64995,"dups":[],"title":"How to backup Angry Birds saves/data?","tags":["backup","angry-birds"],"userid":"363","related":[],"score":36,"answers":["2433","8793","2474","9223","7268"],"acceptedanswer":"2433","creationdate":"2010-10-27T09:34:44.647","favoritecount":17,"comments":[]},"2437":{"body":"<p>Surprisingly I haven't found a satisfactory answer for this in a FAQ somewhere or anything.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Motorola Droid (with froyo, if it matters)<br>\nI am thinking about getting a Samsung Galaxy Tab.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty simple question:\nWhat will happen if I attach the same google account to the tablet?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I do <em>not</em> want to happen</strong> is for the new device to automatically download all of the same apps from my phone, especially the ones that don't make sense on a Wifi-only non-phone device.

However I noticed that only 200-300 MB's are left and marked \"unused\". Also I know that does not necessarily mean that all \"used\" RAM is really in use. For example cached Apps may be held in RAM for faster start-up and this RAM may be freed by Android if more memory is needed.

Although this list contains Apps which may be responsible for almost 100 MBs of RAM but not for 600 MB.

It also provided me a button for killing all running apps. Directly after this still 200 MB's are in use (it says \"kernel memory\") but after 15min again 600 MB's in use (with again 300 MB's per kernel- and app-memory). Is that normal that so much memory is used?, I mean this is factory reset no additional apps were installed by myself!</p></li>\n<li><p>I also tried to to force-close and disable almost all apps which are currently running and which I don't need but still around 600 MB's are in use.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I fear to lose warranty if I open the back of the pad I cannot put off power.
