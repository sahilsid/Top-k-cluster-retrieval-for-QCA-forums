I'm not sure what whitelist rules would be required for this. For example, SSHTunnel connects to the server at x.x.x.x:x, so I presume I'd need a rule to allow connections to this address and this port (I had a quick play with the Avast firewall, which only allows creating custom rules for IP or port, so I'd need two rules with that and it doesn't allow entering the DynDNS name, only a IP address, so that's no good).</p>\n\n<p>Then SSHTunnel has a Local Port (1984) and remote address:port (127.0.0.1:3128) so I presume I'd need rules to allow all of those as well (I'm not sure which of these need to be incoming/outgoing or both). Then there's the question of whether I need to allow other ports like DNS (53) and so on, or if that all goes over the SSH tunnel and doesn't require setting allow rules specifically.</p>\n\n<p>It might be that a VPN server would be more suitable for what I'm trying to acheive than a SSH server and I think the Tomato firmware on the router has that facility (or if the version currently flashed doesn't, there's probably another version I could flash that does), so if that's the case, I'd appreciate advice on locking it down that way instead. Android has built-in VPN support, so it might be possible to use that but it depends on whether it will auto-connect and stay connected all the time or if it requires user intervention and I'll still need to setup firewall rules to prevent data being sent without the VPN in case it does get disabled.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is whether these firewall rules will prevent the device even being able to connect to any public Wi-Fi points before redirecting the traffic via the SSH/VPN server.</p>\n","viewcount":282,"dups":[],"title":"Need help restricting Android tablet to SSH/VPN access only","tags":["vpn","ssh","firewall"],"userid":"46912","related":["2689","2962","50643"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-25T20:12:46.030","favoritecount":0,"comments":["78330"]},"8143":{"body":"<p>Ever since the Gingerbread update, my N1 has been experiencing random audio dropout problems every 5-10 minutes when connected to my car's audio system via Bluetooth.

When you have a home phone and have caller ID display in your plan, it displays the number of the person calling you as well as the name associated to that number in the phonebook. But that doesn't happen on my mobile phone.
