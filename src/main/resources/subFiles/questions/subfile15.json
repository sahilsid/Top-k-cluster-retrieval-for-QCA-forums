One of these issues is with the Blackberry application, Blackberry Messenger. When I'm am contacting someone via BBM and send them a message the message hangs for a while(Keep in mind I have my 4g network on and WiFi with full service) yet it still hangs to send the message. Any other application that requires the network is fine, such as Google Chrome, Snapchat, YouTube, etcetera. Whenever I restart my phone it's fine for a few minutes and then the issue reitterates. What's wrong with BBM and does anyone know a fix, am I the only one with this issue or is it a popular thing on KitKat 4.4? anyhelp would be appreciated.</p>\n","viewcount":66,"dups":[],"title":"Google nexus 5 BBM restart to send messages","tags":["blackberry-messenger"],"userid":"55360","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-03-05T20:27:18.313","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"64884":{"body":"<p>Today I discovered the \"Mark all as read\" function in K9.
