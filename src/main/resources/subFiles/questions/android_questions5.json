Both \"adb and fastboot devices\" show nothing....</p>\n\n<p>There are many threads talking about unable to connect devices but 70% of them are driver-related issue and 30% of them, ex: sudo adb, just don't work for me. I think I am not facing the driver issue because I still can use \"adb shell\" once the device is normally booted (not in bootloader mode). Moreover, I also tried few debrick tools contributed by xda community but with no luck. The most closed thread to this question is: <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/58187/adb-can-discover-devices-but-not-fastboot\">ADB can discover devices but not fastboot</a> \nBut it seems there is no answer for this question.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering if there is any way that I can reflash image to my device without accessing it in bootloader mode? (ex: push image in to device via adb shell when device is normally booted?). I am also wondering if there is any way to fix this problem. </p>\n","viewcount":142,"dups":[],"title":"adb/fastboot can't find device in bootloader, but they can do it when booted","tags":["adb","bootloader","fastboot"],"userid":"65255","related":["58187"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-07-05T23:27:56.197","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"75639":{"body":"<p>I have S4 I9515.

I have restored the contacts back to the phone from the backup file. The problem remains. However... I have made some new discoveries that might shed some light on the problem. Namely, this only affects contacts that were synced to the phone from a PIM software, which in my case is Microsoft Outlook 2010. It does not affect contacts created right in the phone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Replicating the problem...</strong></p>\n\n<p>To replicate the problem, do the following.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start Outlook 2010 and go to Contacts.</li>\n<li>Click on Home and then New Contact. Give it the name \"Home\" and set\nthe \"Home\" phone number to something like 0011223344.</li>\n<li>Click on \"Save &amp; Close\". <em>Note! Make sure you don't have a contact\nwith this name already, neither in the phone nor in Outlook.</em></li>\n<li>Now repeat these steps to create a second contact in Outlook. Name\nit \"Adam Sandler\" and set the \"Home\" number to 0011223344 (the same\nas above) and the \"Mobile\" to 9988776655.</li>\n<li>Now connect the phone to the computer.</li>\n<li>Start Samsung Kies and go to Sync tab.</li>\n<li>Check \"Sync contacts with\" and select Outlook from the list. You can\nselect either \"All contacts\" or \"Selected Contacts folder\" and then\nselect which contacts folder to sync with. <em>Note! If you select the\nsecond option you need to make sure you check the contacts folder\nyou saved the previously created contacts to in Outlook.</em></li>\n<li>Click the Sync button when ready. When done, disconnect the phone.</li>\n<li>Open the Phone app on the phone, dial in HOME, tap the contact name\nthat comes up and then tap the green dial button and watch what\nhappens. <em>Expected behavior is that it should dial 0011223344 but\ndisplay \"Adam Sandler\" on the screen, instead of \"Home\".</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is probably a bug of some sort... Because if you delete these contacts on the phone, and in Outlook, and start all over again, this time creating the same two contacts inside the phone, then there is no issue with dialing. If you dial HOME it will actually say \"Home\" right on the display. Regardless of how many other contacts you got in your phone book that share the same phone number. Hurray!

It works as advertised. I connect to it from my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop running Apache 2.2.22. The laptop is manually configured to IP 192.168.2.100 in the hosts file.

Portscan now shows ports 22 and 80 open. Using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ConnectBot</a> I can login and get my own shell on the server machine by IP address. This should indicate that the network is functioning properly.</p>\n\n<p>I've also install the Dolphin browser on the phone to help verify that it's not an issue with the browser.

The phone seemed to work okay until ICS and it started to get worse with Jelly bean. Now-a-days the phone is really slow and it is mostly unusable. It becomes more unusable when enabling data/wifi. I assume many apps are sent the broadcast message at the same time and they are all trying to perform updates at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>I used to have Watchdog app and for quite a long time I have been monitoring cpu utilization and load average and found it to be high at most times. Until one day, I spotted the available memory was close to zero. Then i assumed the cpu is performing a lot of wasteful GC at most times. Later, I spotted more occurrences of memory plummeting to zero. I noticed that the garbage collection kicks in when I view 'My apps -> Running' and I am not sure whether it happens often enough to make the system performant. </p>\n\n<p>In order to debug, I decided to reduce the number of apps and started uninstalling many of the apps including watchdog but that approach has not solved the problem. I have installed cyanogen updates and that has not solved the problem. I did notice the phone is much faster with the default apps from cyanogen. after installing gapps.zip, android installs more apps based on purchase history and the phone becomes slower. also the phone seems to be faster on restart and after a few days of uptime, it has less memory to work with. i believe there may be a memory leak and not enough memory to launch new apps and does wasteful GC work.</p>\n\n<p>the ways I realize the phone to be slow are\n1. when looking at running apps, android seem to be killing many non-foreground apps as I notice status 'restarting'\n2. when i use the button on my microphone, the beep to the interrupt arrives either too late or it is completely missed. \n3. if i come out of an app to the home screen, I can notice trebuchet initializing</p>\n\n<p>guys, can you please offer some suggestions to debug the issue?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>Currently installed apps</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'

Restarting it shows about 5% battery, again switches off, restart shows around 20% etc. </p>\n\n<p>So I guessed there is some calibration issue. <strong>Taking out the battery at the time of this erratic behavior makes it work fine for a little while</strong> (half an hour to a couple of hours) then again the stupidity starts. I have tried draining the battery to 0% and then a full charge, tried various usage models (not using wifi, disabling animations to reduce usage etc.) nothing seems to work. </p>\n\n<p>I can't properly debug this issue properly as connecting to computer starts charging and when its charging there are no such issues. This is <strong>REALLY</strong> frustrating, Any one has any idea how to debug it? </p>\n\n<p>(I have come to know that certain batch of HTC sensation has this issue, not everyone has experienced similar problems but there are people and no one has been able to point me in the right direction)</p>\n","viewcount":7115,"dups":[],"title":"How to debug a battery issue?","tags":["battery","htc-sensation"],"userid":"18699","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["32122"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-08-30T15:13:31.117","favoritecount":1,"comments":["35620","35632"]},"9213":{"body":"<p>I don't even know why it does this, tbh, since pretty much everyone writes $xx.xx and not anything else, such as xx.xxUS$ or anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Turning off Auto-Punctuate does not fix this problem, so this is my hail mary attempt to get rid of this \"feature.\"  :P</p>\n\n<p>(Edit: My phone is a Motorola Droid 2 Global.

(The data stream should be relatively simple if I understand rightly. Would I need Android drivers for the external USB or Windows drivers for it (if a Windows emulator is to be installed), or both? or is there a smart person who can make a driver for such external devices on a smartphone with Android and make himself 'millions' and avoid Windows altogether, (using perhaps Ubuntu or a stripped down Linux version (- OpenCPN works with Linux)). (Saying that, there will always be companies who make products with drivers for Windows only, so maybe via windows isn't the worst way?). </p>\n\n<p>Boats work on 12v so the optimal solution would be to find a phone/tablet as the 'mother part' in such a system that works on 12v - or - if a voltage converter is to be used, the more efficient it is, the better. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for wanting the device on all the time is for safety at sea - watching for an AIS signal 24 hours a day = a vessel approaching, or so that the 'anchor watch' can be used (= if the vessel moves more than a few metres whilst one is asleep, or the water depth changes, an alarm sounds).</p>\n\n<p>Having researched the issue, it seems no in the whole world has made a system that runs Open CPN that is not laptop based. I haven't even found a tablet based version capable of running the external AIS receiver/GPS as well, which I find almost shocking. But using a phone would mean far less power usage and a cheaper platform, available to all. The ability to then connect an external screen (by the helmsman, for out in the weather, daytime, let's say) would be the creme de la creme.</p>\n\n<p>Got all that?

I've tried at least five different free lock screen apps, but none of them solve my problem--they all still require a PIN to use the camera. <s>I haven't tried WidgetLocker, but I'm not going to pay for an app that I'm not sure will work, especially when all the others I've tried don't work. Does anyone know for sure that WidgetLocker resolves this problem?</s> I also bought and tried WidgetLocker, but it doesn't support PINs at all, and so it is <strong>not</strong> a solution to this problem.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/32029/how-to-use-camera-without-unlocking-phone-jelly-bean-on-s3\">How to use camera without unlocking phone? (Jelly Bean on S3)</a>: </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This answer suggests using Samsung's built in motion. I tried this, and it still requires the PIN to access the camera. This answer doesn't resolve the issue. I'm certainly willing to pay for an app that solves this issue, but I don't need any other lock screen features--I just want rapid access to my camera. Also, I would prefer not to root my phone just for this, but if there is a solution via rooting, I would seriously consider it.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone please suggest an answer that really works?</p>\n","viewcount":5752,"dups":[],"title":"How do you skip the PIN to go directly to the camera from the lock screen?","tags":["lock-screen","camera"],"userid":"40689","related":["14942","29695","32029"],"score":8,"answers":["67557","58642","58287","57372"],"acceptedanswer":"57372","creationdate":"2013-09-03T19:11:28.193","favoritecount":1,"comments":["70727","70741","70744","70769","70773","70782","71250","74365"]},"33078":{"body":"<p>I rooted my phone and tried to use a custom ROM, but I forgot to back up all the data etc using clockwork recovery.

If so, that could destroy a device which is intended to receive only 500 mA.</p>\n\n<p>I can charge the my Android phone using a powered USB port on any computer. How many milliamps does this provide? I read that USB 2.0 will provide a standard 100 mA or 500 mA. Are there another standard amperes which are used for charging?</p>\n\n<p>I found what appears to be a generic <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004EYSKM8\">wall charger for any Micro-USB device</a>. The product description doesn't say how many mA this provides, but from the comments it appears that this charger provides 950mA. Which this overcharge my phone?</p>\n","viewcount":4860,"dups":[],"title":"Are Android chargers universal in terms of power (Voltage, amperage)?","tags":["usb","charging","samsung-intercept"],"userid":"1510","related":[],"score":12,"answers":["12064","4496","42716"],"acceptedanswer":"4496","creationdate":"2011-01-07T20:32:29.103","favoritecount":3,"comments":["85606"]},"4491":{"body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2906/knowing-which-applications-to-stop\">Knowing which applications to stop</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I just got a used Nexus One and I see a lot of running services and applications.

This internal memory has a partition layout allocation around 130 MB for the <code>/data</code> partition and around 290 MB for the <code>/system</code> partition. Both of them are full. (In addition I got a 16 GB SD-card.)</p>\n\n<p>Installing apps, upgrading apps, running most of the apps - impossible. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I knew it's possible to move apps to SD-card, the so called <strong>apps2sd</strong> procedure which offers very limited functionality to move <em>some</em> of the application data to the SD-card.

I gave it a try. I used the instructions from htcdev.com to <a href=\"http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader\" rel=\"nofollow\">unlock the bootloader</a>, I <a href=\"http://androidjinn.com/htc-wildfire-s-root-clockworkmod-recovery-installation.html/2\" rel=\"nofollow\">installed</a> the latest ClockWorkMod Recovery and rooted the device permanently.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I used the rooted device to install <a href=\"http://www.teamandroid.com/2013/01/22/update-htc-wildfire-s-android-412-aokp-jelly-bean-custom-rom/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android 4.1.2 AOKP Jelly Bean Custom ROM</a> and <a href=\"http://a.ndroid.pro/2012/09/htc-wildfire-s%D9%96fed-up-of-the-low-internal-memory-make-a-new-large-room/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data2SD</a> like discribed in the linked articles.

The AOKP-ROM was working pretty well and stable, but installing Data2SD simply did not work in combination with Jelly Bean (SD-card formatting: 11 GB FAT23, 4GB ext4 and 256 MB Swap).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I tried to go for the <strong>link2sd</strong> approach. I reformatted my SD-card (14 GB FAT32 and 2GB ext4) and installed Link2SD on my phone as <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1432459\" rel=\"nofollow\">described here</a>.

You need an MHL converter, or adapter, or something. On one end of the adapter, all resources say, there is a \"standard micro-USB\" port, and on the other a \"standard HDMI port\". If they are all so standard, what's the fuzz about 5-pins vs. 11-pins? The HDMI port must be standard for all displays to work with it I guess, so it must be something on the (apparently not so standard) micro-USB side in the phone. Looking in my phone, I can only see a 4-pins female micro-USB connector. Or are these 11 pins (I have a Galaxy Note II) buried somewhere deeper inside?</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there is often talk about this \"switch\" that's thrown as soon as an MHL adapter is connected. USB-OTG is disabled and it becomes a display input/output port only (input for the remote control, if available). I guess that means it's not possible to connect it through a USB hub to the phone? I need a bluetooth mouse and keyboard instead of a USB mouse and keyboard if I want to do this? Or is this only applicable for the 5-pins MHL devices, and is the point of the 11-pins one that I can connect my USB hub to the micro-USB port on the adapter?</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, I've also seen USB 2.0 to HDMI converters. They're twice as expensive as MHL, but they have a normal USB connection and output HDMI, so that would fit directly in my USB hub. (MHL would also fit through a microUSB->USB converter, but it seems there is something special about the micro-USB end that I don't get.) The question is whether my phone (a Galaxy Note II) has drivers for that kind of hardware, and whether the hub is fast enough. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if anyone knows this, I'm curious about how this works on the inside. The graphics chip of the phone sends the video-out to its micro-USB port, just like it would with HDMI, or does it have some custom protocol that the MHL adapter then converts to HDMI? What about HDCP, how can you prevent someone from reading the output stream if every TV in the world can decrypt it already? Or is it like SSL a way to setup a secure connection to the TV so that others can't read your data stream if they were to capture it?</p>\n","viewcount":4479,"dups":[],"title":"How does MHL work?","tags":["usb-host-mode","usb-peripherals","mhl"],"userid":"28187","related":[],"score":4,"answers":["49447"],"acceptedanswer":"49447","creationdate":"2013-02-17T14:16:07.693","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"39803":{"body":"<p>I bought a new Samsung galaxy S Advance(GT-i9070).

I loaded the firmware using hemdall. It now loads to \"downloading\", every-time you reboot or shut it off and turn it back on. It does however say \"samsung official build\", so at least I didn't download some modified version of the firmware, unless they're that good. Anyways, luckily I have coverage on it. I was told that I just need to call a number and they'll either replace the unit, or give me a refund. I did buy the new Note 12.2 LTE, so it gave me an excuse to get something new I guess lol. Moral of the story, don't assume you're stuff is always backed up, even if it's on auto-sync, verify 100% that it did the last sync.

Around the point where the battery usage started diving, I had added a calendar remainder, sent an email (to a new contact) and browsed facebook (using their app) and twitter (using the web browser).</p>\n\n<p>I've done all of these things many times before. What could have caused the sudden drain, and how can I stop it happening again when I'm not near a charger? (Updated question after picture.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EtqOb.jpg\" alt=\"Battery Usage, Mk 1.\"></p>\n\n<h2>UPDATE</h2>\n\n<p>I've done some experimentation and made some observations. My workplace is in a 3G dead zone, but has 2G thanks to a repeater box someone has installed nearby.</p>\n\n<p>For the past three months, I have left the phone with 'Sync' and 'Packet Data' switched on all the time. When at work inside the 3G dead zone, I sometimes switch on wifi. Before this incident, I've had no problems at all with battery power, despite leaving Sync on all the time.</p>\n\n<p>After posting the original revision of this question, I charged the phone up while it was switched off, went home and only switched it back on when I got home. I had sync and 3G data all night and the battery wasn't rapidly draining.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, the only change I had made was to carry it with me into my workplace and put the phone on my desk. I didn't switch anything on or off, I <strong>only</strong> carried it to my desk. It very quickly started heating up and I noticed that battery was rapidly draining as before.</p>\n\n<p>I began to suspect that the dead zone was causing the problem. To test this hypothesis, I charged the phone up and switched off wifi, sync and packet data. During the day, I switched on wifi and sync in various combinations. (Text continues after picture.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qDvlG.jpg\" alt=\"Battery usage on second day.\"></p>\n\n<p>The kink in the graph is around 20 minutes where wifi and sync were both switched <strong>off</strong>, but packet data was switched on. During those 20 minutes, the phone was heating up and the battery was draining. When I switched packet data off, normal battery use resumed.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: Something in my phone has a bug where the battery starts draining badly while in a 3G dead zone and packet data is switched on.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this only started happening very recently. I've had this phone since January and have left both packet data and sync switched on almost continuously. I've not knowingly had any software updates recenty and the 3G data availablity of my workplace has been consistently very bad for some time.</p>\n\n<p>Does please anyone know of a fix? </p>\n\n<p><sup>(Many thanks to m'colleague <a href=\"http://computerdissection.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duncan Large</a> for taking the pictures and helping test the hypothesis.)</sup></p>\n","viewcount":8706,"dups":[],"title":"What's causing battery drainage by \"Google Services\" while packet data is switched on in a 3G dead zone?","tags":["samsung-galaxy-s-2","battery-life"],"userid":"13309","related":["9453"],"score":13,"answers":["27577","28874","22312","40433"],"acceptedanswer":"22312","creationdate":"2012-04-23T17:10:44.973","favoritecount":0,"comments":["25875","34188","34189"]},"22176":{"body":"<p>I've been trying to figure out if it's possible to disable/enable GO SMS popup notifications via something like Tasker.
