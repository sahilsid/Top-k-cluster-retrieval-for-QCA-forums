More specifically I'd like to find out if it's the Android 2.2 release that added support for real dual SIM and dual GSM support, and to which extend both cards are online or usable as data channel.</p>\n\n<p>A question about <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/865/dual-sim-android-phone\">Dual SIM Android phone?</a> already came up here, but it didn't investigate the issue completely. And the mentioned mobile (Tiger G3) was also most likely incorrectly reported as Android phone. From all pictures I've seen it's a regular chinese MTK/NucleuOS phone.</p>\n\n<p>I want to base my question on the STAR A3000 as hardware example. It's verified that it is really running Android, and dual SIM capabilities seem very plausible:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=A3000\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=A3000</a><br>\nI'm linking to a search listing and not a shop or review directly to avoid the impression of spamvertizing. It's also a more long-lived link that way. But foremost I want to highlight that there are two hardware versions. The original A3000 runs Android 2.1 and offers no dual SIM capabilities. All newer listings advertise both Android 2.2 and dual SIM support.</p>\n\n<p>The trouble with chinese mobiles and resellers is that not all details are super reliable. You'll have to cross check multiple sources, and better assume the lowest common denominator. In the above shop search some Android 2.2 dual sim A3000s are for example still depicted with the original hardware version. I've seen a few images (and there's a youtube video) with the dual sim slots, so I presume this verified. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.50391\" rel=\"nofollow\">rumor (on dealextreme)</a> that both hardware versions are identical and there's just a black cover above the second sim slot for the first version (looks plausible from pictures). So that's why I assume that Android 2.1 didn't support such features, and the Android 2.2 kernel maybe introduced it.</p>\n\n<p>The hardware in this phone most likely supports not only dual SIM, but dual GSM. This means that both SIM cards are connected the whole time, to two different networks. All previous MTK chips and mobiles support that.<br>\nHowever I've seen one picture of the A3000 Android 2.2.1 version which shows a configuration screen with an option along the lines \"[x] Select SIM card at bootup\". This would suggest that it's not a real dual-GSM setup, but just dual-SIM - which only allows switching. Yet <em>all</em> the listings from my first link suggest that the phone and Android is \"dual sim dual standby\". So I'm confused.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the question: Did Android 2.2 introduce proper support for dual-GSM? I know none of the big brand vendors supports anything like that, so it must be a fringe feature, maybe not even in the OHA documentation. Any chance something like this was mentioned in some sort of release notes? (Really I have no clue, no Android phone yet, still gauging.)</p>\n\n<p>My main interest is keeping my main phone number, and using a secondary SIM and contract for data connnections preferrably. Or the other way round.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another note. I know there was also the General Mobile DSTL1 once, which was the first (and for a long time only) Android 1.5/1.6 phone to advertise dual-SIM. I don't know to which extend it supported real dual-GSM functionality. But it's interesting that old Android versions allowed it. So I'll extend my question into why no Android 2.0 and 2.1 phones with dual-sim existed. Did the feature possibly come and go twice in Androids lifetime?</p>\n","viewcount":1868,"dups":[],"title":"A3000 chinese mobile - Dual-SIM or Dual-GSM support since Android 2.2 (again?)","tags":["dual-sim"],"userid":"1492","related":[],"score":2,"answers":["5952","50973","5237"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2011-01-15T20:35:19.520","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"4769":{"body":"<p>I am considering buying a new phone.

During calls, the screen keeps turning itself on, with of course all kinds of fun buttons like \"End\" and \"Mute\", free for my cheek to press.</p>\n\n<p>After dialing, I turn the screen off, and put the phone to my ear. But then, when someone answers my call, it turns back on, and then it's easy to forget to turn it off one more time.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if I change in-call volume with the volume keys - and depending on the other person's whispery-whispery-soft or harmful-and-super-loud device, I need to do this often, to protect my ears or my ability to understand what they're saying - well, it turns back on.

I've tried a whole lotta tutorials, from XDA to the rest, telling me I need to flash a new radio but the problem is I have not been able to do that because of some errors I get when using the fastboot command (permission denied to be specific from the adb command interface).

The phone was advertised as having 1GB internal Memory and also came with a 4GB Micro SD.</p>\n\n<p>I've used the phone for about a week now and noticed something which I believe is drastically wrong with the Memory Scheme. As I've downloaded apps, they seem to not be using the internal memory properly. On the Applications Manage screen, the apps take up \"System Memory\", which is about 190MB maximum. As you can imagine, this space is used up rather fast after only a few apps installed. So I tried to see if I could move apps to the SD Card, but there's the hitch. The option didn't refer to an SD card at all, but was a greyed-out \"Move to Internal Memory\". A few of the apps had this option, and when I selected it they began to take up the 1GB Internal Memory, which was not used at all before. The option for memory management then read \"Move to Phone\". Also, I noticed that as I installed more apps RAM was being used even before the Apps started running.</p>\n\n<p>My theory is that the phone was poorly configured. A section of RAM is being treated as the Internal Storage or Flash Memory or whatever you call it, which was labelled \"System Memory\". The actual, 1GB Internal memory is being treated as external storage much as an SD card would, which leaves the real SD card out in the cold.
