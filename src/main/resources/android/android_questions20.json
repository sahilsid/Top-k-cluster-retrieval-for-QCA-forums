I'm technically-minded but new to this OS. I'd like to find a calendar that runs in limited security permissions, so that my calender isn't synced to anywhere over the internet. I am happy to take responsibility for my own backups.</p>\n\n<p>I have signed up for a Google account to run the stock Calendar app (it mandates it), to access Google Maps and to access the market. I've set the Google account to \"Sync is OFF\" in General Sync Settings, and I've turned off Auto Sync. I've kept Background Data turned on, and turned off Google syncing in the Calendar options. I am hoping this combination of settings means that my calendar will not be copied off the device, though I'm not confident this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn't aware until after purchasing that app-level security permissions could <em>not</em> be modified in Android - some light research just now suggests that one needs to root the device to get that feature. (I may well do that, but I want to get a working set-up first). Since the sandbox permissions for Calendar are <em>do what you want</em>, I've been looking at alternatives. <strong>Jorte Calendar</strong> requires wide permissions, and <strong>Smooth Calendar</strong> looks like it just relies on the standard Calendar app as storage, as I think does <strong>GO Calendar Widget</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm okay with <em>limited</em> data flowing to Google/Microsoft/BigCorp - such as map usage or market searches. But I'd plan to avoid using remote storage for private data: my contacts, texts, calendaring and so forth (there's something about Calendar refusing to start without a Google or FB account that is a touch irksome). I could use a local calendar on my old Sony K660 without wondering if it was being copied without consent - are there calendar apps that will do this? Or is rooting &amp; resetting perms for Calendar my best option?</p>\n\n<p><em>Addendum</em>: in Privacy Settings, I've turned off Back Up My Data. Turning it on then off again reveals this dialogue box message: <em>Are you sure you want to stop backing up your settings and application data and erase all copies on Google servers?</em>. So that's a reassurance that file system data won't get synched by the stock OS - just Contacts and Calendar to go <code>:-)</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Post Addendum</em>: I suggested in the comments that I might use the Corporate feature, in which one can add a Microsoft Exchange account. However this appears sadly to be subject to similar privacy objections that I apply to the Google account requirement. The user is asked for an email and password, and is confronted with this message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By activating this application you accept that part of your mobile phone data (comprising IMEI and model name) will be stored, processed and used by Samsung for the purpose of reporting activation of the application to the licensors of the application software itself. Such data held by Samsung will be dealt with strictly in accordance with Samsung's privacy policy. A copy of the policy is available upon request. Continue?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Admittedly this is a small privacy risk compared to the wholesale copying of a calendar or contacts, but it still emphasises the point that the corporate storage of ones data is essentially mandatory. (Added here for the benefit of search engines on this topic.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, it may still be worth a go. For those of us without access to a real private Exchange server, one would need to find something to emulate one, so that the Google account can be removed.

I need to explain all this to help others and to avoid helpful contributors to provide answer without asking clarifications.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My requirement in one line: \"to enable an Android phone to display Tamil characters properly\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elaboration:</strong>\nTamil, like any other Indian language has complex character rendering system. Unlike English or other Latin based script, it has glyph (what you see in screen) composed of more than one character. \nAndroid does not have ability to render such complex scripts (with exceptions). My aim is to know how I can provide such an ability to an Android phone or tablet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Little background that I gathered so far:</strong>\nTo display a glyph in screen, Android first needs a suitable font file.  Android device has a folder <em>/system/fonts</em> which has few of them.  The most interesting file in that folder is the DroidSansFallback.ttf.  As the name suggests, when Android's system fails to find a character in system fonts (that could be DroidSans.ttf or DroidSans-Bold.ttf etc) it falls back to search it in DroidSansFallback.ttf.</p>\n\n<p>By replacing a suitable font file from PC (Latha.ttf or Lohit-Tamil.ttf - these are fonts for Tamil) and DroidSansFallback.ttf will enable to display Tamil characters in the device.\nIt is not so easy to replace and it involves rooting the device and mounting the system as writable. </p>\n\n<p>In spite of those troubles, even if the DroidSansFallback.ttf is replaced, the Tamil characters that are displayed are not rendered properly.  The Tamil character \"தி\" is a conjunct of two characters and instead of getting displayed as \"தி\", it will be displayed as \"த ி\" without space in between. Though this is enough to read short messages, it cannot be used to read books etc.</p>\n\n<p>From Android 4.0 on wards, Tamil and other few languages are supported through browser as said in Android 4.x API overview as seen below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Support for Indic fonts (Devanagari, Bengali, and Tamil, including the complex\ncharacter support needed for combining glyphs) in WebView and the built-in Browser\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The words to notice is \"in WebView and the built-in Browser\", which means that Tamil characters will be rendered perfectly if it is rendered as HTML content and will not be rendered otherwise.  Opera and other few browsers did this even before Android 4.0 by substituting image instead of character.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that in few devices that target Indian market (ex: LG Optimus One, most of Samsung phones and tablets) are able to display Tamil properly both in browser and even in places out of browser like in contacts, text messages, file names etc.  To my surprise they do this even in Android 2.3 onwards.  I also noticed that the same model targeting non-Indian country running same version of Android does not support Tamil character display.</p>\n\n<p>This made me to investigate further and reached a conclusion that Android (as other Linux based OS) depends on a font rendering engine to display such complex characters.  The two engines that I came across are Skia and Harfbuzz. I noticed LG uses skia and Samsung uses Harfbuzz libraries in their devices to bring this ability.</p>\n\n<p>I came across many websites suggesting to replaces these libraries and fonts. It did not work and results in freezing.  Fortunately I backed up using clockworkmod and hence I restored my phone.</p>\n\n<p>Though I had explained this with Tamil, this is applicable for most of the Indian languages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here comes my question (if you are still reading;) )</strong>\nNow, far sure it is clear that a TTF file should be present to provide characters and an appropriate libraries (libskia.so or libharfbuzz.so) are required to render them correctly.  Does any one know how these manufacturers are able to provide the ability? I am even ready to build my own ROM from AOSP (Android Open Source Project).</p>\n","viewcount":38440,"dups":[],"title":"How to make an Android device to display complex rendering of Indic characters?","tags":["languages","localization","fonts"],"userid":"9556","related":["1184"],"score":30,"answers":["41576","33145","26290","26285"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-07-06T11:10:29.703","favoritecount":14,"comments":["39702","82562"]},"77782":{"body":"<p>I try to download apps like Vine and other apps but, it continuously says insufficient storage and I have an sd card and enough internal storage to download.

This is my first Android phone and my first time trying to do this.  I do come from a programming background, so I didn't anticipate it giving me any trouble.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Droid Razr and I had Gingerbread 2.3.6 on it before I rooted it.  After the root, it started giving me notifications for the 6.1...something update, but since I rooted it, the update wouldn't take.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to put Eclipse ICS ROM on it.  First, I backed up my apps, put Safestrap into safe mode, and created a backup.  I followed the directions <a href=\"http://droidrazrroot.com/droid-razr-hacks/how-to-install-rom-on-rooted-droid-razr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for flashing the ROM.  I waited about 5-10 minutes after rebooting - the Motorola logo came up on my phone, followed by the Safestrap boot options, then nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I rebooted and got into the Safestrap menu and tried to restore my backup ROM.  The restore failed.  I tried formatting the device through Safestrap and it still didn't start up.</p>\n\n<p>I followed the directions <a href=\"http://droidrazrroot.com/droid-razr-unroot/how-to-unrootunbrick-your-rooted-droid-razr-back-to-android-2-3-66-12-173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> up to step 7 to unroot/unbrick.  This uses Droid Razr Utility 1.42, and everything I tried came back with a \"command failed\" message.  I thought it was a little strange that the only option it was giving me was to restore version 6.12.173 while I had 2.3.6, but I figured I would at least try it, and I thought that was why I was getting the \"command failed\" message.  After googling, I downloaded Droid Razr Utility 1.8 and tried restoring it to 6.16.211 (official kernel) - again, the only option it gave me.</p>\n\n<p>After that, I can no longer enter Safestrap.  The phone doesn't boot - it goes through the Motorola logo and then shows a small bar of static right at the bottom of the screen.  Fastboot recovery and restoring the phone to factory settings makes an error show up on the screen (the Android mascot and an exclamation point in a triangle).</p>\n\n<p>I can still enter into Android recovery and I still have access to the contents of my SD card.  I can see the folder where my Safestrap backup should be, but there's nothing in there that the phone recognizes as bootable.  I can still also access the Eclipse.zip file.
