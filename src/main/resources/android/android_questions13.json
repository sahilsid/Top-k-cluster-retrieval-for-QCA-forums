These apps' primary purpose is managing to do lists and projects, but they have secondary minor features that use these permissions (I think it is for scheduling responses to missed calls and sharing tasks by SMS).</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to allow any non-official app on my phone to make phone calls or send SMS. It's just not something I need 3rd party apps to do for me, and I'm not interested in these secondary features. The developers look reasonably legit - but I generally prefer not to feel like I'm unneccessarily handing a company I don't know an open wallet. But I would, ideally, like to be able to use these apps for their primary features, which appear to be very good and better than the competition for what I want. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to download these apps and prevent these permissions from being used?

Likewise for custom ROMs.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mind if it's a blunt solution that stops any app except the Android phone interface itself from making calls or sending SMS. In fact, that would be ideal. I thought about trying to use an app like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tasker</a> to set up a trigger on any ongoing call or SMS that cancels it if it wasn't called directly by the Android phone interface, but I doubt that it would work (and of course Tasker uses these permissions itself...).</p>\n\n<p>Also ideally I'd prefer not to need to spend lots of time in airplane mode unable to receive normal calls or messages - but I'll accept a strong solution that involves using airplane mode some of the time if there is no better approach.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't mind if a solution causes the app to crash or force close any time it tries to use one of these permissions.
