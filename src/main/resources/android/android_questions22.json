Namely, this only affects contacts that were synced to the phone from a PIM software, which in my case is Microsoft Outlook 2010. It does not affect contacts created right in the phone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Replicating the problem...</strong></p>\n\n<p>To replicate the problem, do the following.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start Outlook 2010 and go to Contacts.</li>\n<li>Click on Home and then New Contact. Give it the name \"Home\" and set\nthe \"Home\" phone number to something like 0011223344.</li>\n<li>Click on \"Save &amp; Close\". <em>Note! Make sure you don't have a contact\nwith this name already, neither in the phone nor in Outlook.</em></li>\n<li>Now repeat these steps to create a second contact in Outlook. Name\nit \"Adam Sandler\" and set the \"Home\" number to 0011223344 (the same\nas above) and the \"Mobile\" to 9988776655.</li>\n<li>Now connect the phone to the computer.</li>\n<li>Start Samsung Kies and go to Sync tab.</li>\n<li>Check \"Sync contacts with\" and select Outlook from the list. You can\nselect either \"All contacts\" or \"Selected Contacts folder\" and then\nselect which contacts folder to sync with. <em>Note! If you select the\nsecond option you need to make sure you check the contacts folder\nyou saved the previously created contacts to in Outlook.</em></li>\n<li>Click the Sync button when ready. When done, disconnect the phone.</li>\n<li>Open the Phone app on the phone, dial in HOME, tap the contact name\nthat comes up and then tap the green dial button and watch what\nhappens. <em>Expected behavior is that it should dial 0011223344 but\ndisplay \"Adam Sandler\" on the screen, instead of \"Home\".</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is probably a bug of some sort... Because if you delete these contacts on the phone, and in Outlook, and start all over again, this time creating the same two contacts inside the phone, then there is no issue with dialing. If you dial HOME it will actually say \"Home\" right on the display. Regardless of how many other contacts you got in your phone book that share the same phone number. Hurray!

The one that does not work is called ubuntu-31patch.zip and it was made to flash a more up to date kernel and 3.1.10 kernel modules were also provided but this zip does not work for some reason and I can't figure out why. The one that works for me is here 2.6.24.4 i think is the kernel version number:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/60048492/transformer/Ubuntu-mountloop.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/60048492/transformer/Ubuntu-mountloop.zip</a></p>\n\n<p>if that does not work, you might find a new link here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1537566\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1537566</a></p>\n\n<p>3) The sl101 sliding keyboard does not work but if you plug in an external usb keyboard, the usb keyboard will work. no idea how to get around this problem but .... having the sl101 is useless if the sliding keyboard can't get working.

It works as advertised. I connect to it from my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop running Apache 2.2.22. The laptop is manually configured to IP 192.168.2.100 in the hosts file.

I've also checked out a few similar questions on this site, but none of them quite match my details. So here they are:</p>\n\n<p>I have a Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0) that's been working fine with my wifi router since I got it about 6 months ago. This morning when I fired it up, it rebooted and now I cannot connect to my wifi router. My wifi is not the issue as my Nexus 7 tablet is connected and working. </p>\n\n<p>This is what I see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When I go to Settings > Wi-Fi, I see my network listed. But status is stuck on <code>Obtaining IP address</code></li>\n<li>After a while, status reports <code>Network disabled. Poor connection</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tablet also reports that a \"Software Update\" is ready. Not sure if this is related to the issue. But when I try to update, I get a confirmation page and when I hit confirm button, I get message <code>Unable to connect network</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rebooting tablet</li>\n<li>Forgetting and reconnecting to my network through Wi-Fi settings</li>\n<li>Read <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/a/40296/35024\">this solution</a>, but couldn't find Mobile Network Settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's some system data from my tablet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Model Number: GT-P3113\nAndroid Version: 4.0.4\nKernel Version: 3.0.8-999349\nBuild Number: IMM76D.P3113UEBLH2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A simple solution would be appreciated. I'll post a solution if I figure it out myself.
