I have revisited this thread every time I had to install Android SDK. The trick that the author uses is to simply replace the hardware IDs in the INF file to those that actually correspond to the actual hardware device that's being connected.</p>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken I had the same ID as the author describes in the thread, that is <code>USB\\VID_0bb4&amp;Pid_0c94</code>. But now when I check it I have a different one.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0h4zg.png\" alt=\"driver properties\"></p>\n\n<p>I recently flashed the phone. But I used the RUU original image, with the same build number as the one that was already on the phone. The RUU was the HTC original ROM Update Utility that was used to flash it. I had to do this to enable the use of Unrevoked to root and then Alpha Rev to set S-OFF. Could it be that, in some way, this changed the hardware ID? I thought hardware IDs were supposed to be permanent and fixed to the hardware?...</p>\n\n<p>Using the second driver, with unedited INF file, and trying to update the ADB device in Device Manager, this is what it says.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W5BDq.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/a0sua.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p>It just simply fails to install it, because the IDs don't match. Now, these are the lines that I used in the edited version of the INF file. These now include the actual IDs of my phone.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Google.NTx86]\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;MI_01\n\n[Google.NTamd64]\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;MI_01\n\n[Strings]\n%SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87&amp;REV_0226\n%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87\n%SingleBootLoaderInterface% = USB_Install, USB\\VID_0BB4&amp;PID_0C87\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now when I try to update the driver again I get to the warning message, you know the usual Windows warning about installing software of unknown source.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jflBp.png\" alt=\"driver update\"></p>\n\n<p>So I click to install it anyway.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vAZIp.png\" alt=\"driver update\">\nAnd it tries to install it but then halts and says that installation failed and something about ADB Composite.</p>\n\n<p>So why does it fail to install? And why was my hardware ID changed in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Is there no \"normal\" way of installing this stupid driver? You know, without having to hack the damn thing or play tricks with it?...</p>\n\n<p>I know that some users suggest that one should obtain the latest sync software from the manufacturer because with that also come some USB drivers that are necessary to have. But I don't want any of the HTC bloatware. And I don't have any problems transferring files between the phone and the computer when in \"Disk drive\" mode. So I don't need anything else. And isn't this the driver for using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) which is part of Android SDK? I mean shouldn't Google be the one that provides a working driver then?...</p>\n\n<p>Just for the record, the phone in question is HTC Desire, the original one. You know, the first one, not any of its' many siblings that followed.</p>\n\n<p>Please have a look at this, and let me know what you think this could be. And also let me know if you know of any alternative ways of doing this, just for future use. I am sick and tiered of having to this every single time I want to install the Android SDK. I normally only do that when I need to reinstall Windows, but once installed and set up I usually don't touch it, but I do reinstall Windows at least two times a year.</p>\n","viewcount":5135,"dups":[],"title":"How do I patch the Android ADB driver?","tags":["usb","adb"],"userid":"27231","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["42525"],"acceptedanswer":"42525","creationdate":"2013-03-27T15:15:12.860","favoritecount":0,"comments":["57335","57371","58131"]},"42497":{"body":"<p>I am running 4.5.91 currently on a rooted and unlocked Atrix.</p>\n\n<p>Will I brick my phone by updating to 4.5.141 from OTA source?</p>\n\n<p>Can I re-lock the boot-loader if that is the issue?</p>\n","viewcount":180,"dups":[],"title":"Atrix 4G update via OTA with unlocked bootloader?","tags":["bootloader","ota-update","bootloader-lock","motorola-atrix-4g"],"userid":"19168","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["42999"],"acceptedanswer":"42999","creationdate":"2013-03-27T22:57:25.130","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"42490":{"body":"<p>Generally I get alert when I am in call .

Maybe others experiencing this issue use scheduled TitaniumBackups, too? The hint was that since upgrading to 2.2.1 I also upgraded to the licensed TitaniumBackup version and scheduled daily backups. But this may just be coincidence.

When the system is powered on the <strong>BIOS</strong> initializes and does sanity checks on the computer's hardware and peripherals. The <strong>BIOS</strong> is 'firmware' and exists outside of the computer's normal storage. Even if the system was started with no mass storage, the <strong>BIOS</strong> would still be there. The <strong>BIOS</strong> runs a piece of software in the system's storage called the <strong>bootloader</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bootloader.</strong> The <strong>bootloader</strong> uses and is itself a set of files on the filesystem, sometimes in the /boot directory. The <strong>bootloader</strong> (depending on the case) presents a list of options for how you want to proceed in starting the system.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Each option (usually) corresponds to starting a <strong>kernel</strong> with specific <strong>boot parameters</strong>. The <strong>kernel</strong> is a binary contained in a package file called <strong>vmlinuz</strong> (or similar) that resides somewhere on the filesystem (like the /boot directory). The <strong>kernel</strong> creates abstractions between hardware and software, like the hardware interfaces, filesystem abstraction, processes and threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes <strong>vmlinuz</strong> also contains some utilities that are put into folders like /sbin. Things that are in <strong>vmlinuz</strong> cannot be modified without repackaging a new <strong>vmlinuz</strong> file, and replacing the old one.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>kernel</strong> loads <strong>kernel modules</strong> which do various things and are sometimes drivers. Some <strong>kernel modules</strong> are built into the <strong>kernel</strong>'s binary file and some are separate files on the filesystem, sometimes in the /usr/lib/modules directory.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>kernel</strong> also starts a program called <strong>init</strong> which is in a location that is sometimes specified in the <strong>boot parameters</strong>. <strong>init</strong> mounts mass storage devices to directories and starts a bunch of programs. These programs are on the filesystem and usually have all their files in /usr. They are called the system's <strong>userland</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>In Android, there is a Java-like virtual machine called <strong>Dalvik</strong> which is started by <strong>init</strong>, which is what most programs run within. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Rooting</strong>: Rooting a device allows users to grant themselves root permissions.</p></li>\n<li><p>To simplify managing all the software on the system, a system usually has a special program called the <strong>package manager</strong> which can manage, update and install sets of related files as `packages' corresponding to individual development projects. Android's interface to its package manager is the <code>Application Manager</code> in settings. Applications are available for download via the Play Store</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Home Folder</strong>: Users have a directory in /home where all their files are stored (including local configuration settings for applications). </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Recovery</strong>: a separate userland which the bootloader launches that only does system related tasks. You get to it by restarting your device while doing a special dance with the buttons.</p></li>\n</ul>\n","viewcount":174,"dups":[],"title":"What Android parts do these terms describe?","tags":["rom-flashing","custom-rom","rom","system"],"userid":"26025","related":["2885","2885"],"score":2,"answers":["59494"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-12-22T00:45:17.023","favoritecount":1,"comments":["80770","80772","80774","80775"]},"34314":{"body":"<p>Is there an App that registers itself as a Share Command and lets me send a selected text in a webpage or email to the default dialer?\nI would like to avoid copy and pasting a number from a webpage or email to the dialer manually...</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n","viewcount":231,"dups":[],"title":"Send selected text to dialer","tags":["dialer"],"userid":"15331","related":[],"score":6,"answers":["35552"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-11-29T00:22:23.210","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"34315":{"body":"<p>My Galaxy Nexus has just been updated to v4.2 of Jellybean, Google seem to have totally changed the camera app in this update and there's a few functions that I just can't find.</p>\n\n<p>As I'm travelling a lot at the moment, I like to make sure that most of my pictures are geo-tagged so that I can work out where I was and when later!

I put that in quotes because it was a custom ROM that claimed to be 4.0 but which I suspect was actually Gingerbread+.</li>\n<li>My RAM typically runs at about 85%. But, I doubt this is too useful since Android automatically kills apps when it needs more RAM and the Linux kernel is designed to keep RAM mostly full so as not to waste it.</li>\n<li>Currently, Google Maps is using the most battery, followed by Tasker. I'm quite sure that this isn't typical, however. I can't imagine why Google Maps would be so high, as I don't use it often. Anyway, I turned off the location permissions, so hopefully that'll cure Google Maps. And Tasker doesn't usually consume so much, but when the CPU is pegged it seems to have a harder time operating than most apps.

They're so severe that it's often faster to reboot than to try to use the phone without rebooting.</li>\n<li>Auto-rotate seems to have no effect. I regularly toggle it in the normal course of using my phone, and haven't noticed any difference either way.</li>\n<li>Apps would appear to be the culprit since I've experienced the same issue on two different phones and since doing a factory reset. However:\n<ul>\n<li>The process that's consuming the CPU <em>isn't</em> an app but <code>system_server</code>, which is a core part of Android.</li>\n<li>I have a lot of apps, so disabling them one by one would be a time-consuming process.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>I tried re-nicing <code>system_server</code>, but I didn't se any effect.</li>\n</ul>\n","viewcount":20628,"dups":[],"title":"Why is my phone slow?","tags":["samsung-galaxy-nexus","performance"],"userid":"14562","related":[],"score":8,"answers":["32740","39278","36870","32737"],"acceptedanswer":"32737","creationdate":"2012-11-01T06:34:09.077","favoritecount":1,"comments":["42325","42328","56964"]},"35042":{"body":"<p>For those people who are interested in flashing custom roms after rooting their android device:</p>\n\n<p>Does a website exist that provides a definitive, quick &amp; up to date guide to the numerous and varied custom roms that are available for the android platform (obviously not the whole kaboosh, but something that gave a flavour).
