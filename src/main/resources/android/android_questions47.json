You want to type 300 characters (something like three SMS) and you want to do this as fast as possible. Given my typing speed on the touch screen (even utilizing various speed up input software), I am still typing at something like the fourth of the speed as on a normal keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>This scenario could arise in the following places:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As a passenger in a car/train/airplane</li>\n<li>While walking (actually while biking in my case, but this is not recommended)</li>\n<li>While sitting in a sofa/chair</li>\n<li>While lying in bed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have come across various wireless keyboards, which could be utilized. The problem is that if I need one hand to hold the phone (in order to read what I type) and one to hold the keyboard in most of the scenarios above, I am left with at best a few fingers to type on the keyboard, which would hardly be better than using the touch screen.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I am thinking about a keyboard with a holder, which would need to be really tall in order to be close enough for me to actually read what I type. I imagine that the time it takes to set up something like this, would mean that it would not pay off for just typing the 300 characters.</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion so far, is therefore, that there is no current solution to this problem, which would make me faster, apart from buying an android phone with a built in keyboard. Are there any alternatives I have missed?</p>\n","viewcount":223,"dups":[],"title":"What kind of hardware can be used to speed up the writing on android phones?","tags":["keyboard","hardware"],"userid":"2632","related":[],"score":2,"answers":["10044","10021","58598"],"acceptedanswer":"10044","creationdate":"2011-06-03T10:01:08.393","favoritecount":0,"comments":["12132"]},"14588":{"body":"<p>In Google Maps Android 5.10 you can save a place by clicking and starring the place.

So\n  making the appropriate ioctl(2) calls into the kernel was the best\n  choice.

The actual encryption used for the filesystem for\n  first release is 128 AES with CBC and ESSIV:SHA256. The master key is\n  encrypted with 128 bit AES via calls to the openssl library.</p>\n  \n  <p>Once it was decided to put the smarts in vold, it became obvious that\n  invoking the encryption features would be done like invoking other\n  vold commands, by adding a new module to vold (called cryptfs) and\n  teaching it various commands. The commands are checkpw, restart,\n  enablecrypto, changepw and cryptocomplete. They will be described in\n  more detail below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Android does not an existing tool due to licensing issues...

It turned out to be a branch of <a href=\"http://www.mobileshop.eu\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobileshop.eu</a>, which was also unheard of by me or anyone I know. I'm saying this because I cannot be sure whether the OS itself was bought infected or with a backdoor or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>After several weeks of using, I've noticed rapid battery drain overnight, from 70% to emptying(the phone was turned off when I woke up). Not sure whether it's important, but sometimes, when I turned it on again, I got report that battery is on 252% or similar numbers - I assumed wrong calibration. The weird part is, when my phone 'survived' the night (happened a few times), and I tried to use it in the morning, it felt like I was fighting with someone to control the phone, like someone was tapping on my screen - except no one was near me. I solved that problem once by turning it off (took me a couple of minutes, the other <em>one</em> was fast), and when I figured out I could just remove the battery I used that 'technique' (duh, mornings). Then I'd just turn it back on and it'd be normal, for the rest of the day. After a few days I've started turning off wi-fi&amp;sync (mobile data was always off), and my battery only have lost a couple of percent. When I turn them back on in the morning, it's normal.</p>\n\n<p>The thing that persisted is the silencing of the phone and/or putting it on vibration. I'm sure that didn't press the button accidentally or something, that can happen even when the phone is just sitting on the desk. From what I've noticed, the screen doesn't turn on, but I hear the vibration. Cannot tell whether that happens overnight, since my phone is usually on vibration/silenced during that period of the day. I've checked the app permissions, didn't notice anything weird (if you could instruct me for what to look, I'd be grateful). Only non-play app I've installed is the Youtube Downloader from github.</p>\n\n<p>So, does anyone have any idea what I'm dealing with? I'm quite new smartphone and Android user, but I know my way around desktop PCs/Linux/Java/some C and experimenting with them, so any help is welcome. If it is a virus, what is the best way to remove it? From what I've read, the Android antiviruses aren't really effective (and if there are any that could help me, please list them), and custom ROMs should erase everything (I'm ready to take that step if needed), but are there any more options? Rooting the phone and uninstalling everything?
