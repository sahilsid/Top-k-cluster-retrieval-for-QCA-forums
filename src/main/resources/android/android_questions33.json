Was known working for quite some time, and susceptible to the \"sleep of death\" that left it not powering on until you long press the power button while touching the screen.</p>\n\n<p>Device has never been rooted, used only lightly, never dropped, everything points to a simple software/firmware problem (doesn't even have the screen glue problem like others in its batch). Charging cable works (and has worked in the past), device \"should\" be charged (left plugged in overnight), though they designed it without <strong>any</strong> hardware indicators of charge status.</p>\n\n<p>Things I've tried that numerous forums like XDA and android Forums recommended <strong>(but do nothing)</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hold power button for 30 seconds</li>\n<li>Hold power button for 30 seconds and touch/wiggle finger on screen (used to help, no longer does anything)</li>\n<li>Hold power and up/down volume alternatively (or any combination thereof)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, this is theoretically just an expensive paperweight, therefore I am quite willing to do damage to it to get it working again, or simply use it as parts. This must be a \"simple\" firmware problem, so I feel that I shouldn't have to take a spadger to it and wrench out the battery or solder in a debug cable just to get it to do something.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nTo note, on neither Windows or Linux does any device show up or get mounted when the device is plugged in during any of the procedures mentioned above. Nvflash sees nothing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>\nTo those reading unfamiliar with the Galaxy Tab 10.1, it seems to be a mostly poorly designed device with only three physical buttons (Power, Volume Up/Down), and possibly zero indicator lights. This makes the number of options left for the consumer to debug it next to nil. I'll wait a week, and unless anyone has a better idea, I'm <a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-101/6258363?seq=12&amp;tag=content;siu-container#photopaging\">literally cracking the sucker open</a> and physically removing the battery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong>\nOkay Android peeps, I couldn't wait any longer and went ahead and cracked the sucker open. They were right, the back plastic is very delicate (and snapped in two places, purely cosmetic though). It's fairly tidy inside, and the battery and guts are easily exposed. My attempt to read the voltage of the battery revealed it to be.. basically dead. No real voltage at all. My best guess at this point is that somehow the charging circuitry requires some kind of minimum current available in the battery before it will attempt to charge it (or perhaps enough to boot and allow the software to handle it). Seems pretty stupid to me. If I can get my hands on a replacement battery, or a something to charge the existing battery directly, <strong>OR</strong> a wall wart to provide the 3.7 volts directly, I will try that.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, looks like I'm totally SOL and I'd have better luck posting into the Hack-a-day QA forums than a respectable software specific support forums like Android Enthusiasts. Thanks again guys! Maybe I'll be back again later for assistance getting Ubuntu installed on my Droid 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FINAL EDIT!:</strong>\nAfter a quick jaunt over to Hackaday, I got some confirmation that the actual read voltage across my battery terminals was BELOW the minimum for Li-Ion, so they battery was basically dead. Another quick run to ebay found me a \"new\" one for ~$35. 5 days later and I shoehorned the new battery in and tada! It works! .. sort of. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the undue stress of being discharged (or perhaps being so lonely), the boot process was broken and it was stuck in an endless boot loop. AFter about 4 hours messing with it trying this method to do fastboot and user wipe, but finding out that windows failed to recognize the it as anything but \"Unkown Device\", after another 2 hours of hacking around i come to find out it's my horrible cheap chinese knockoff cable that's the culprit!!</p>\n\n<p>Found the original cable, plugged it in, fastboot works, try to wipe with fastboot -w, just hangs. Fooey. Next I follow <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYBs98R9rTs&amp;feature=relmfu\">this unbrick method</a> using the odin download to flash a \"Stock\" rom. This works! Yay!!! Unfortunately it's back to android 3.2... but I can't complain, as I am now the proud owner of a $35 (+ 10 hours of work) android tablet.</p>\n\n<p><em>What</em> an adventure.

I lost my original backup so I used the generic stock backup that comes with nabilab2. This put the device back to US stock, with no root privileges or serial number.</p>\n\n<p>There were three ota's, during the instal of the third one, the device crashed - a ton of text sprawled up the screen the device shut down-restarted and booted into &lt;3e> recovery.

Here is where I am now; The device boots and is usable, I can install apk files and use the tablet normally, however I cannot update. The last ota I need to install downloads via the update service, but fails with errors upon install. I also downloaded the ota manually via the xda forums nabi 2 wiki page and tried to install from the sd card but that fails too. (maybe as my UK stock with serial device, is now a US stock with no serial device, which is causing a signature fail during install of the latest ota?). The device is no longer rooted, so no shell r/w access. I cannot see the device in fastboot. Using the command 'reboot recovery' reboots the device but then it freezes up and is no longer seen via usb. When 'Fastboot recovery' option is chosen in &lt;3e> recovery the device locks up, and the same thing happens when choosing 'Forced recovery'.

So unless there is some way to get the required recovery files onto the device by the adb command without su access (I'm doubtful of), or via a modded/signed recovery image zip file within &lt;3e> recovery (which again I'm doubtful of, as other signed .zips fail), I'm guessing that the device is bricked?</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback to help solve/answer will be gratefully appreciated.</p>\n","viewcount":435,"dups":[],"title":"Fuhu Nabi 2 tablet bricked <3e> recovery","tags":["unbricking"],"userid":"57819","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["66936"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-03-31T21:41:21.753","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"66633":{"body":"<p>So I got a new phone (Moto G) about 3 days ago (newest version os) and I've tried to connect to my school's internet, which requires usename/id and password.

But it is unstable and show similar issues in the web log: <code>PTY allocation request failed on channel 0</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT-3</strong>: After login (with new sshd server) with: <code>ssh -T dummy@192.168.1.10 -p 2222</code>, I loose prompt, but shell access is still ok. then running <code>su -c /system/bin/sh -i</code> give me back the correct <em>su</em> prompt # and checking <code>set -o</code> gives:</p>\n\n<pre><code>u0_a202@MSM8960:home # set -o\nCurrent option settings\nallexport      off  login          off  nounset        off  verbose        off\nbgnice         off  markdirs       off  physical       off  vi             off\nbraceexpand    on   monitor        on   posix          off  vi-esccomplete off\nemacs          on   noclobber      off  privileged     off  vi-tabcomplete on\nerrexit        off  noexec         off  restricted     off  viraw          off\ngmacs          off  noglob         off  sh             off  xtrace         off\nignoreeof      off  nohup          on   stdin          on\ninteractive    on   nolog          off  trackall       off\nkeyword        off  notify         off  utf8-mode      off\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But TAB is still directly interpreted as a TAB character and not command-line completion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT-4</strong>: This must be a <a href=\"http://selinuxproject.org/page/SEAndroid#Getting_Started\" rel=\"nofollow\">SELinux</a> / <a href=\"http://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/se-linux.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEAndroid</a> related issue, as when I disable SELinux <strong>Enforcing</strong> by setting it to <strong>Permissive</strong>, I loose the ability to SU, but all normal shell terminal controls are working. The way to do this is by issuing: <code>su 0 setenforce 0</code> in whatever shell you can get, and then logout and login again. This will last until you reboot phone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT-5</strong>: From what I understand, using the <code>ssh -t</code> option, is used to force allocation of a pseudy-terminal, and terminates the connection if that fails. Thus it fails when pty is blocked in \"<em>Enforcing</em>\" mode, while using <code>ssh -2</code> is accepted with minimal difference in error when using <code>-vvv</code> to debug. </p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ssh -t dummy@192.168.1.10 -p 2222 -vvv\n...\ndummy@192.168.1.10's password:\ndebug3: packet_send2: adding 64 (len 51 padlen 13 extra_pad 64)\ndebug2: we sent a password packet, wait for reply\ndebug1: Authentication succeeded (password).\nAuthenticated to 192.168.1.10 ([192.168.1.10]:2222).\ndebug1: channel 0: new [client-session]\ndebug3: ssh_session2_open: channel_new: 0\ndebug2: channel 0: send open\ndebug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com\ndebug1: Entering interactive session.\ndebug2: callback start\ndebug2: fd 3 setting TCP_NODELAY\ndebug3: packet_set_tos: set IP_TOS 0x10\ndebug2: client_session2_setup: id 0\ndebug2: channel 0: request pty-req confirm 1\ndebug2: channel 0: request shell confirm 1\ndebug2: callback done\ndebug2: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768\ndebug2: channel_input_status_confirm: type 100 id 0\nPTY allocation request failed on channel 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not accepted, but this next one give me a shell without any prompt.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ssh -2 dummy@192.168.1.10 -p 2222 -vvv\n...\nPTY allocation request failed on channel 0\ndebug2: channel 0: rcvd adjust 2097152\ndebug2: channel_input_status_confirm: type 99 id 0\ndebug2: shell request accepted on channel 0\nLinux 3.4.0-2340422 armv7l\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This behavior is convincing me to think it is directly related to the SELinux blocking <code>pty</code> access.

So I went to the main menu and noticed all the apps are there but it became gray colored with the same icon (Android with SD text on right corner).</p>\n\n<p>When I pressed the app a message saying the app is not installed on the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Another important thing is that I am unable to locate the google play store anywhere, even under the <em>Setting->Apps->All.</em> Actually, I can't find all the missing applications -- though in main menu I saw the gray colored play store icon (not google play but play store)</p>\n\n<p>I don't think the SD card is the problem since my music and images are still there just fine, not to mention a few games apps still working fine even though they are also stored in SD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>edit:</strong>\nJust now I tried to access google play store with internet browser on phone and tried to download the missing apps again but I can't, it gives the message <code>your device already has this item.</code> Even if I want to un-install the missing apps, I can't because I cannot locate them under <em>Settings->Apps->All</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>QUESTION</h3>\n\n<p>What do I need to do to fix this problem?
