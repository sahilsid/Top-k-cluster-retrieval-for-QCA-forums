In TWRP recovery console - I am able to access and push files to and from /sdcard folder with no problems, and see its content with adb shell.</p>\n\n<p>When android loads - <code>cd /sdcard</code> + <code>ls</code> shows that it is empty (even though it does contain files copied to it in recovery console mode) the reason for this is that with ls I can see that <code>/sdcard</code> points to <code>/storage/emulated/legacy</code> which points to <code>/mnt/shell/emulated/0</code> which DOES NOT exist. <code>/mnt/shell/emulated/</code> folder exists, but it is empty.</p>\n\n<p>I am unable to use the device - just start the OS (and get the error messages when trying to launch applications). When the OS loads I immediately get the \"unfortunetley, google play store has stopped\" error without doing anything.</p>\n\n<p>running google earth application when logcat active gives the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>E/cutils  (10727): Failed to chmod(/mnt/shell/emulated/0, 0): Read-only file system\nE/dalvikvm(10727): cannot mountExternalStorage(): Read-only file system\nI/ActivityManager(  492): Start proc com.google.earth for activity com.google.earth/.EarthActivity: pid=10727 uid=10024 gids={50024, 3003, 1015, 1028}\nD/dalvikvm(10727): No JNI_OnLoad found in /system/lib/libearthmobile.so 0x41dc5158, skipping init\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any idea how do I solve this?

Late last week I started looking into it and I found out, much to my utter horror, that it wasn't my company's server that was at fault, it was the IM app's server -- I have been logging in to my company's server through their server for months now, meaning that their server had access to my password (which can be used for just about every system I use at work).  I verified this by rooting my phone, installing WireShark and looking at the network traffic.</p>\n\n<p>I've asked for my money back, since I paid for the app, but I really want to get the app removed from the marketplace, as it's a huge danger to anyone using it.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I have no proof that this company was harvesting anyone's password, but they could be doing it.  Regardless, they're transmitting my login credentials in the clear (though they are encoding the password, which I'm sure will deter all but the most hardened hackers -- not!).</p>\n","viewcount":146,"dups":[],"title":"How to \"report\" a mis-behaving app?","tags":["google-play-store"],"userid":"135","related":[],"score":7,"answers":["3580","3586"],"acceptedanswer":"3580","creationdate":"2010-12-12T23:50:23.197","favoritecount":1,"comments":["3452","3475","3478"]},"75039":{"body":"<p>I'm trying to update my Nexus 4 from 4.4.2 to 4.4.3 and every time the message pops up, I select install and clockworkmod recovery keeps saying error, installation aborted, STATUS 7.

It assigned me an i/p address and thus made it work but spoiled it for my other housemates, so I had to get the setting back to WEP.I know it is more secure to use WPA, but I cannot change it without asking my landlord.
