On the phone it would say it was on, but as soon as the phone connected to the car, the audio would stop reflecting the changes I would make on the equalizer or any preset settings I had selected. Without the equalizer, the music sounds flat and dead, so I switched over to PowerAmp and gave that one a try.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the equalizer issue was gone, but now whenever I go to skip tracks from the cars steering wheel control panel, the song will skip, but immediately pause. I've tried everything I could, Googled for days to find a fix, and nothing has been able to alleviate this issue of pausing after track skip.</p>\n\n<p>Fed up with that, I went over to PlayerPro and everything is good now, but the track info that shows up on the dash is always stuck on the first song to play when the phone connects to the car. So if track 1 was the first song that I play when I get in the car then it' stuck on track 1's info displaying even if I switch tracks or even albums. </p>\n\n<p>That last one is a minor issue, but it's getting very frustrating finding a player that will just WORK with out having all these erroneous issues pop up. I just switched over from using iPhones for 5 years now and love this phone. So much more customization and ability to do what you want with your phone. I wish I would have switched over earlier. This has been the only issue I have so far faced that has really bugged me and cause much heartache. Has anyone had these issues and if so, did you find a solution, or is there another player out there that I am missing that might work with my setup. I've been to numerous Mazda forums, and the developer forums, and alas nothing and no one has had a solution to my problems. I'm hoping I can get some help here. Thanks in advanced for any and all help. </p>\n\n<p>D.</p>\n","viewcount":715,"dups":[],"title":"Music Player over Bluetooth Issues","tags":["bluetooth","4.3-jelly-bean","music-player","samsung"],"userid":"48160","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-12-17T13:10:01.870","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"59155":{"body":"<p>On my mobile phone I have not got SD card.

I'm now thinking about buying a new Android smartphone, if I can be sure that in the end I'll be able to realize this goal with it. So my main question is: <strong>What do I have to look out for in order to get a device with which I can give projector presentations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I apologize that this question is not exactly about a concrete problem I'm faced with right now – I just don't want to purchase a costly device only to find out later that I can't do with it what I want. I therefore did some thinking and research about the <em>possible</em> problems, and ask you for advice on how to avoid a concrete problem to occur in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some issues that occurred to me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In my experience most projector installations in lecture halls still only provide access to a <strong>VGA</strong> connector. I know that VGA as an analog signal requires D-A conversion from a digital signal, but I'm confused about how much effort this takes: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004B65KXQ/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_9?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2SPS3CI7RTX03\">Some</a> converters have the shape of a box which needs an extra power supply, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Adapter-Audio-%C3%9Cbertragung-Konverterkabel-Unterst%C3%BCtzung-digital/dp/B00DP1OOSK/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AEB9F56C3A3O6\">others</a> are very small and don't need extra power. <strong>What is the difference between these different types of devices, and which kind do I need?</strong> Please note that the links are only meant as examples, I'm not asking specifically about these products.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again in my experience, most installed projectors do not yet support Full HD, but still need signals at resolutions like 800x600 or 1024x768. At least <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0085B5KPQ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2XW1R8G26C2W1\">some</a> HDMI-to-VGA converters appear to support <strong>downscaling</strong> from Full HD to VGA resolutions. Since I probably can't control this from the smartphone/tablet: How does it work? Can I trust that the optimal resolution is automatically negotiated between the adapter and the projector? Can I expect a decent-looking result from the downscaling, or will it be all washed out? Practically speaking: <strong>Is there a specifically named feature of such converters that I should look out for when choosing one?</strong> Again, the link is only for reference.</p></li>\n<li><p>Android apps normally have screen output optimized for the fixed, physically small screen built into the device and not the flexibility that is provided by changing the screen resolution or resizing a window on a Desktop OS. Is it a realistic goal to achieve a <strong>good presentation experience</strong> from a mobile device similar to the one from a laptop? E.g. it appears not to be possible to get Adobe Reader for Android into a proper one-page-fullscreen mode. <strong>Is there presentation software that does this better?</strong> I'm mainly thinking of presentations in pdf format.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And maybe there are caveats I'm not even thinking of?</p>\n","viewcount":7515,"dups":[],"title":"How to use an Android phone or tablet to make a projector presentation?","tags":["video-out"],"userid":"46126","related":[],"score":13,"answers":["57158","57343","59245"],"acceptedanswer":"57158","creationdate":"2013-11-02T18:23:09.927","favoritecount":5,"comments":[]},"1834":{"body":"<p>My Android device (on Verizon) will sometimes display 3G in the status area, and sometimes display 1X.

It was clearly GEN1 a while ago, and I have a feint recollection that Mr Pigfish said it's still GEN1 after I installed the official update (though I'm not sure now).

There is an obvious tension here between (1) my freedom, as the device owner, to turn off the shutter sound, and (2) my expectation of privacy, i.e. that others will not take pictures of me in public without my knowledge / consent. This question is NOT about whether (1) trumps (2) -- that is subjective. And yes, I know you can disable the shutter sound if your root your phone. This question is ONLY about where the legal boundary lies in various parts of the world.</p>\n","viewcount":6657,"dups":[],"title":"Jurisdictions where camera shutter sound is mandated by law","tags":["audio","camera"],"userid":"22918","related":["89"],"score":8,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-10-27T03:38:03.250","favoritecount":1,"comments":["42005","42017"]}}
