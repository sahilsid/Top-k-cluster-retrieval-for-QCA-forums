This is also how apps gain or rather request access to networking services during installation by requesting to be added to the INTERNET group or something like that, don't quote me on the name of the NET net group, it might be more like INET or INET6, either way I know there are several levels of network access that can be granted to an application through this mechanism on Android.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, where is this information stored in Android?</p>\n\n<p>Further more, is it possible to modify? </p>\n\n<p>I would like to integrate a glibc stack with it and the data within it in my <code>/etc/{passwd,group}</code> files, trust me, they exist on my phone, I even have apt installed with a lot of other goodies.</p>\n\n<p>Update:\nHave been doing more searches and \n<a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/8452/how-to-know-app-name-by-uid/8465#8465\">This might be what I am looking for.</a></p>\n\n<p>I will need to dig a bit deeper and make sure it is everything I am looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Update: (5:40 June 27 2014)</p>\n\n<p>Since someone thinks I don't know what I am doing or talking about, let me clarify;</p>\n\n<p>User UIDs on Android are offset with 100000 and App UIDs are offset with 10000 when mapped to the user number _ app number, hence when a ps shows something like u0_a10 which means that User with UID 100000 is running app with UID 10010,</p>\n\n<p>I have pulled UID and user/daemon names from system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h and used those to update my /etc/passwd and /etc/group files (On my Android box), for example my /etc/passwd file (on my Android box) looks like this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>....\nbrainard:x:100002:100002:Professor Brainard,0420,,:/home/brainard\n:/bin/bash\nradio:x:1001:1001::/data/radio:/bin/false\nbluetooth:x:1002:1002::/data/bluetooth:/bin/false\ngraphics:x:1003:1003::/home/graphics:/bin/false\ninput:x:1004:1004::/home/input:/bin/false\ncamera:x:1006:1006::/home/camera:/bin/false\nlog:x:1007:1007::/home/log:/bin/false\ncompass:x:1008:1008::/home/compass:/bin/false\nmount:x:1009:1009::/home/mount:/bin/false\nwifi:x:1010:1010::/home/wifi:/bin/false\nadb:x:1011:1011::/home/adb:/bin/false\ninstall:x:1012:1012::/home/install:/bin/false\nmedia:x:1013:1013::/home/media:/bin/false\ndhcp:x:1014:1014::/home/dhcp:/bin/false\n....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have set up configuration in /etc/adduser.conf to create new users like so ( On my Android box) :</p>\n\n<pre><code># FIRST_[GU]ID to LAST_[GU]ID inclusive is the range of UIDs of dynamically\n# allocated user accounts/groups.\nFIRST_UID=100001\nLAST_UID=199999\n\nFIRST_GID=100001\nLAST_GID=199999\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is in accordance with Android's policy, I let \"glibc based\" system users still be created from range 100-999 I believe and I modified the audio user on my /etc/passwd and /etc/group files to be of 1005, like it is on Android.</p>\n\n<p>I need to update Android and synchronize it with info regarding my User UIDs as well as with my Daemon or system user UIDs from the glibc stack.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about this in the book \"Embedded Android\" by Karim Yaghmour\n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1449308295\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sold here</a></p>\n\n<p>My goal is to get programs like nvlc to work but I need to get UIDs and GIDs synchronized so that Android is aware of my users and the groups they belong to so that for instance, my brainard user with have access to the audio devices.</p>\n\n<p>Also I need to inform Android about Postres and it's membership in the network group so that it can open sockets and allow access to databases.

I have an <strong>LG Marquee</strong> with <em>Boost Mobile</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours ago, I opened up my gallery and the screen froze, then a force-close option popped up (which happens a lot with this phone so I'm used to it &amp; thought it'd just force-close &amp; then go back to normal as usual). Instead, the screen went blank &amp; the blue icons (home, options, back, search) started flashing.</p>\n\n<p>My phone had restarted completely: I had no service, my wallpaper was blank, etc. My phone does this a lot actually, but will just go back to normal. This time it started up normal, but the SD card icon appeared on my notifications bar &amp; it read \"checking SD card for errors\". Typically this would occur but then the \"Media Scanner is Running\" icon would appear &amp; my phone would be fine. The \"media scanner running\" pop up never appeared, and the blue icons just started flashing again as the screen went blank, only to reboot once again.</p>\n\n<p>My phone kept rebooting itself repeatedly for about an hour every minute or two (making it impossible to make a call or send a text!!) Then I finally just turned it off. Every time it'd reboot, it'd last a couple minutes &amp; the \"media scanner running\" pop up would come up, then it'd reboot all over again. Seems as though the media scanner triggers the reboot :/</p>\n\n<p>After reading through many posts on the Internet about this issue, I tried a few things. In attempting to fix the problem, I realized that this issue has nothing to do with my phone itself or the battery - it's the SD card. I haven't dropped my phone at all lately and typically refrain from downloading extra apps that I really don't need. Mostly my SD card is taken up by photos, texts, videos, contacts, &amp; three or four extra apps. The last app I downloaded was last night, it was a photo/gallery organizing app. When the reboots started occurring, I quickly uninstalled the app but it didn't fix the problem. The SD card doesn't look physically damaged at all, &amp; neither does the small port it goes in. I use a 2GB micro SD card, the one that came with the phone when I bought it (not the best choice, I know, I just figured I could make due with it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>I can run my phone perfectly fine</strong> without the impeccably annoying reboots occurring <strong>if I take the SD card out</strong>. The problem is that I obviously need my pictures and videos and other apps, etc. I had quite a few photos and videos, all of which I would be completely devastated and flat out pi**ed off to lose (especially because I had a lot of photos of a close friend that passed away recently in my gallery. Losing those would really make me sooo mad!) All I can do on my phone right now is access the internet, make calls, texts but I have none of my pics/vids &amp; almost none of my apps.</p>\n\n<p>Please help me!! Not only do I want my media and apps back, the constant rebooting is a level of annoying I can't even begin to describe!! I would literally appreciate it so much if someone could help me fix this issue (without having to reformat my SD card and lose everything)': ) and would be forever grateful!! I don't know how you reward/give a thanks to someone that helps you out on here, but I'd happily do it for anyone that can help me fix this problem ASAP. I'm soo unbelievably frustrated, please help me. Thanks so much!</p>\n\n<p>(BTW, my phone is not rooted and none if my photos, videos, or other SD card things are backed up - dumb, I know!!
