Instead of rebooting my phone's display goes black for a second, shows the Huawei logo and turns completely off. If I kill the google play process before shutting down it works. I noticed this issue a short time after rooting and then reinstalled the gapps (they had been installed as system apps), I had removed previously and the issue was gone for a while. Now the same issue is back after installing <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stericson.permissions.donate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Permission Denied</a>, or this is rather when I noticed that the issue was back, as I'm not entirely convinced that this was caused by installing this app as this issue was already present earlier (I tried if uninstalling Permission Denied made any difference but it did not) and it is now persistent. I even ended up restoring all pre-installed \"system\" apps with Titanium Backup. Though restoring the gapps failed, which I then partially restored using the Backup app that came with my phone and by reinstalling directly from play store. However the issue is still present after restoring/reinstalling all previously uninstalled apps and clearing google play's and google play service's caches and wiping data. And I've only removed gapps which are available in the play-store to begin with (Chrome, Google Play Movies, Google Play Books, Google Play Music, Google+, Hangouts, Google Play Newsstand) and also only those, which were save to remove according to other user's experience with this device. The only other apps I removed was a homescreen gadget by Huawei and a DLNA app by huawei. Now I believe that this isn't really related to removing pre-installed apps at all (I listed the system apps I uninstalled regardless, in the case that it may still be important) and now I am kind of at a loss as I've already tried everything that came to my mind and googling didn't get my any further either.

It just hangs there....</p></li>\n<li><p>But if somehow got it to get into normal working(I donno how, but It sometimes boots ok and gets into normal working mode, with home screen and apps and everything). So once I get it right the other problem I am having is that the touch is giving VERY bad response. I have to click at spots multiple times to select that thing. Also the response is very slow. Its like the tablet is hanged. But when I tried connecting a mouse (through OTG) and everything works fine again. Is my touchscreen gone bad..??</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am already done with, reset (from \"settings> backup and reset\") [I cant find how to do factory reset on this model from \"off\" state(read below)]</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to get into reset screen by pushing \"Power Button+Vol up\" button. Then I know the tab gets turned on (I can hear a small white noise from the loudspeaker) but nothing comes to screen. So the \"Robot with heart open\" is never shown. \nI also tried using \"power button + Volume down\", this takes me to a screen written in chinese. \nNow, I don't know Chinese but from the look and feel, its a troubleshooting window, where I can check weather components of my tablet are working (eg. I click one menu(with difficulty), then the front cam turns on, another menu makes loud sounds from speaker and another flashes many colors in screen etc). I found that most are ok except something called \"T\" (On the screen, its the last item to the right, is it \"touchscreen\"??)</p>\n\n<p>So, what can I do to get my tab to work smooth again..?\nIs the touchpad having trouble..? Need I do any specific troubleshooting..??\nAny Ideas on which key combinations to get on to the \"factory reset\" menu from off state..??</p>\n\n<p>Now, I seems I have lost the ability to boot into Android.
