As the name suggests, it uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">APT</a> style repositories, which I'm used to from Linux (Debian and derivates). It even lets you have your own private repo to share apps between devices (or with friends). All apps are offered for free, so no need for a \"license server\". But <strong>how safe is it for the end-user?</strong> I've googled (and ducked) for hours, but could not find any source on this. Instead I found a lot of links of the type \"get paid apps for free\", \"black market\", and other piracy-oriented stuff – which is definitely not what I'm after. I'm more than open to pay for good apps<sup>5</sup>, so \"getting them for free\" is not the intention behind my question. Like <em>F-Droid</em>, <em>Aptoide</em> has multiple repositories – but I couldn't figure out whether there's a \"trust-able\" main repository like with <em>F-Droid</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There is related information available in the package description (e.g. <a href=\"http://webservices.aptoide.com/webservices/2/getApkInfo/package%3anet.wigle.wigleandroid\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide package info for Wigle Wifi Wardriving\">this one</a>) indicating safety measures such as malware scan, signature validation, and third-party-validation. But as the <a href=\"http://m.hidiho.store.aptoide.com/app/market/net.wigle.wigleandroid/58/4837328/Wigle%20Wifi%20Wardriving\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide page for Wigle Wifi Wardriving\">corresponding web page</a> shows, this information seems to be at least partly relying on user feedback (which could be faked/manipulated), or is not even presented to the user (the package info e.g. names 3 scanners used to check, I cannot find this info on the web page). While I might be able to look things up via package info, I cannot ask e.g. my 70+ years old parents to do so. On <a href=\"http://m.aptoide.com/1000contest\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Aptoide Trusted $1.000 Contest\">this page</a>, <em>Aptoide</em> also points out how to see results of their security measures, and explicitly states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aptoide Anti-Malware platform analyses applications in run-time and disables potential threats <strong>across all stores.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Emphasis mine) – which suggests a malware protection comparable to that of <em>Google Play</em> (how does that go together with those \"black market rumors\"? Maybe they just don't <em>remove</em> offending apps, but only <em>mark</em> them instead?).</p>\n\n<p>So finally</p>\n\n<h2>The question:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a way to safely use <em>Aptoide</em> as source for apps? If so, how?<sup>6</sup> If not, why not?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bonus points for an \"idiot proof\" way which could be recommended to less experienced users.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n\n<p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I know it would be possible opening the <em>Google Play Store</em> web page of the app, scroll through it, and click the corresponding link when found – but you can't call that user-friendly, or expect users doing this on every update.<br>\n<strong><sup>2</sup></strong> e.g. on first install it requested the \"unsuspecting\" <code>READ_PHONE_STATE</code> with the usual justification. With an update, it could request <code>CALL_PHONE</code>, <code>PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS</code>, and others – and the Play app would not bring that up, as they belong to the \"same group\".<br>\n<strong><sup>3</sup></strong> To figure \"new permissions\", one had to compare those of the installed version with those of the present one. Have fun!<br>\n<strong><sup>4</sup></strong> I've just edited two answers and added some details on <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/posts/217/edit\">AppBrain</a> and <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/posts/7496/edit\">F-Droid</a> to fill those gaps<br>\n<strong><sup>5</sup></strong> I've bought a lot of apps on <em>Google Play</em> (or donated to the dev directly), and e.g. <em>F-Droid</em> has donation buttons on each app's page to make this possible<br>\n<strong><sup>6</sup></strong> I could imagine by knowing (and restricting your use to) \"safe Aptoide repositories\" this could be achieved. But as I wrote, I couldn't figure out which ones to consider \"safe\". The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptoide\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wikipedia: Aptoide\">Aptoide article on Wikipedia</a> suggests there's a \"default repo\" on install, and more repos need to be added manually; so it might be sticking to that first one is safe.</p>\n","viewcount":3431,"dups":[],"title":"How safe is it to use Aptoide?","tags":["alternative-markets"],"userid":"16575","related":["216","216"],"score":4,"answers":["74813"],"acceptedanswer":"74813","creationdate":"2014-06-21T19:03:59.393","favoritecount":1,"comments":["97478","97483","97551"]},"74617":{"body":"<p>I have a Kobo Arc 10HD and it runs on Android 4.2.2.

Knowing I like to tinker with these things, she offered me the phone in whatever condition I can muster from it. </p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, she dropped it into some water and from that point on, the android OS will no longer boot. The bootloader screen comes up when powered on (without forcing this mode using the hardware volume buttons), but that's as far as it goes. I don't believe this is a boot-loop, as the phone does not automatically reset itself, but I'm somewhat new to the terminology. I don't believe this question is quite a duplicate of <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/49608/38101\">this one</a>, as the screens I am able to access are different.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a <code>DROID X</code> (<a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/48462/38101\">similar question for this model</a>), but for those unfamiliar, the bootloader presented using the volume-button-on-boot method does not produce the same screen. on the <code>X</code>, there are actual options, such as loading fastboot, etc. With the <code>2/R2-D2</code>, there are no options, just \"OK to program\". I am not sure if the bootloader is unlocked or not. The working D2 is in stock condition, and the bootloader menu is minimal as compared to that of the X, and the non-working bootloader is identical. If the stock condition is locked, then I assume that this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>I can force recovery mode (holding the keyboard 'x' while booting), but the options there do not help.</p>\n\n<p>From the bootloader screen, this is what I see:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Always this header</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Bootloader\nD2.37\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if battery is charged</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Battery OK\nOK to Program\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if battery is depleted</em> (I think, the batt's full at the moment and my memory may be off):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Battery low\nUnable to program\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if no USB connected</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Connect USB\nData Cable\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>if USB connected (to PC or straight power)</em>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>Transfer Mode:\nUSB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From the recovery screen (after loading the <code>!</code> image and getting to the actual menu by pressing both the volume up and down buttons at the same time), this is what I see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Android system recovery &lt;3e&gt;\n\nAndroid system recovery utility\n\nreboot system now\napply update from sdcard\nwipe data/factory reset\nwipe cache partition\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of the above options, I have tried all, but I know the sdcard option was done incorrectly, as I am not sure which files are required for this update. The other options, which 'worked' resulted in no change in the boot behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The phone is detected by my Windows 7 machine. i.e. When I plug the device into the PC, Windows detects the hardware and recognizes the R2-D2 as being the same (no new drivers required) as the Droid 2, and I can see it in my list of devices in My Computer.\nHowever, I can't run any debug functions on it. i.e. The D2 (essentially the same phone, same hardware, drivers, etc.) that I regularly connect to my PC to test my own programmed apps, and ADB works flawlessly. Any attempt to debug the device results in the device not being found by adb. While in either the bootloader or in Recovery Mode, the R2-D2 cannot be detected by <code>adb devices</code>. If I plug in the functional D2, adb immediately is able to display the device ID.</p>\n\n<p>Also tried to see if <code>fastboot</code> would detect the device, but it did neither at the bootloader, nor in recovery mode.</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded a series of <code>.sbf</code> files from various sources (<a href=\"http://sbf.droid-developers.org/cdma_droid2/list.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> being the only one I can find at the moment), and reflashed using RSDLite. I am new to this and so I used numerous walkthroughs from the web to get me this far. I am somewhat confident that I've learned how to flash properly, since some of the attempts failed and caused the bootloader to fail, but a few of them at least got me back to the same 'working' condition the phone was in when I picked it up.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I don't care if the phone is rooted or not; I don't care if I have a custom or stock ROM loaded; I don't care if the OS is buggy once running. I would just like to be able to get the phone to boot at all. The original owner has since picked up a replacement from Verizon, so worst-case scenario (the phone is a brick) is not the end of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Especially given the fact that I have a nearly identical phone to work with, is there some way I can rip the <code>.img</code>s from the working model and load it onto the broken one? Is there a step in the <code>.sbf</code> reload that I could be doing incorrectly?
