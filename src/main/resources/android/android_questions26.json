As I understand it, removing the <code>aboot.mbn</code> and <code>sb*.mbn</code> files simply prevents them from being installed.  I doubt this helps if your device already has KNOX installed.  </p>\n\n<p>Could I first downgrade my GT 7100 to a pre-KNOX firmware?  And then flash a new firmware with the KNOX bootloader removed?  Or could I simply substitute the <code>aboot.mbn</code> and <code>sb*.mbn</code> files from a previous Samsung firmware?  </p>\n\n<p>Also, how could I actually find an old firmware for the Galaxy Note II?

Is this a problem?  Is Odin required to avoid setting some warranty void bit or osmething?</p>\n\n<p>Now my current firmware is N7100XXUEMJ9, which I've managed to download, appears Russian.  The most similar firmware available on Samsung's site is N7100XXUENC3.  It does not contain the <code>aboot.mbn</code> and <code>sb*.mbn</code> files.  Instead N7100XXUENC3 has <code>sboot.bin tz.img boot.img recovery.img system.img modem.bin cache.img hidden.img</code>.
