Given the application developer has provided one layout only (for small devices) and the app is being run on a large display. Scaling may will look terrible (especially if the scale factor is in range 2-3), because it was not designed for this, so maybe a better solution is to show a smaller version of the app in the middle of the screen. Then it will look as designed, except that it will make poor usage of the available space. However, scaling it a little bit should be fine (scale factor in range 0.8-1.5), so that the app occupies entire screen. The question is what Android is doing? Does it scale the app even if it's scaled by a large factor (over 2) or will it stop at some factor and simply place smaller version of the app in the middle of the screen?</p>\n","viewcount":142,"dups":[],"title":"What do apps designed for small screens look like on tablets?","tags":["applications","tablet","screen-resolution"],"userid":"6694","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["48981","48982"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-07-11T21:38:46.097","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"48987":{"body":"<p>I have changed everything in my rooted HTC One SU (t528w) mobile to remove chinese characters.

I have spent the last 4 hours scouring 100's of forum posts, reading ADB documentation, looking through wiki articles trying to learn the ins-and-outs of recovery roms, flashing, etc., and I still don't have a working solution -- not because the things I've tried haven't worked, but because information is so obscure and vague that I have no idea what to try.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Droid Razr Maxx HD Global. The screen and digitizer are both broken. I have a new identical working device. I want to transfer <em>everything</em> -- system settings, app data, etc. -- from the old device to the new device. It's easy enough to move the SIM and external SD to the new device but I still have the issue of internal storage.</p>\n\n<p>The phone is stock. USB debugging is disabled. I can't use ADB because of that. I also can't use tools like MobileTrans (or whatever) because of that. I can't enable USB debugging because I need the screen. <strike>I don't have a USB On-The-Go and I don't even know if it would work with my device. I don't have an HDMI cable or a monitor that accepts HDMI.</strike> I have tried multiple USB On-The-Go adapters and multiple mice and none of the mice are recognized. I have an HDMI cable and an HDMI monitor which works but does not help with the digitizer issue.</p>\n\n<p>The most promising looking path I see so far is to install a ROM that has USB debugging enabled. Maybe it's a regular ROM, maybe it's a recovery ROM, I have no idea. I have this RSDLite tool that I guess flashes regular ROMs, or maybe recovery ROMs, or both, I can't tell. I have a regular and recovery Cyanogen ROM image. RSDLite can't load it. RSDLite doesn't show my device. I saw a few people say \"oh just boot into fastboot and use that\". Ok I'll just, uh, press the \"boot into fastboot and use it\" button? I have no idea what fastboot is other than a tool that I have in my ADB installation.</p>\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/a/12887/46219\">this answer</a>, which recommends typing <code>setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1</code> somewhere, although I don't know where. The poster says, amusingly, <em>\"The Droid X does not have a physical keyboard - but if it did you could try this in a terminal.\"</em> Anybody have any ideas about this one? My imaginary keyboard on my Razr doesn't work either. (Update: This requires screen access and a terminal on the phone, so, as per usual, that doesn't actual answer the question that was asked.)</p>\n\n<p>I did try \"using\" (fsv of \"using\") fastboot to boot with the Cyanogen recovery ROM (which may or may not be the correct ROM and may or may not have debugging enabled and I don't actually know if \"boot\" permanently modifies the device or not):</p>\n\n<pre><code>fastboot boot /path/to/some_arbitrary_rom_i_got_on_the_internet.img\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it just got stuck on <code>&lt;waiting for device&gt;</code> and eventually gave up, something that all the answers involving fastboot seem to neglect to address. Not really sure how to proceed there, or if that's even the right path to be going down. (Update: Apparently the power + volume down button boot menu is called \"fastboot\" mode -- odd that it's this easy when all mentions of \"fastboot mode\" on the internet seem to involve some huge chain of drivers, weird tools, and arcane commands and never mentioned that on Motorola devices it's just the plain old boot menu. I will try this when I get home from work.)</p>\n\n<p>The flood of advice like \"yes just select X and Y in the boot menu\" seems to help nobody with this problem because, obviously, the screen is broken.</p>\n\n<p><em>HOW</em> (keyword: <em>HOW</em>) do I <em>somehow</em> enable USB debugging on a device with a broken screen? Do I use fastboot for something? Do I find a ROM of some sort with USB debugging enabled? What ROMs have USB debugging enabled (it's not exactly something listed in their feature list)? How do I <em>actually</em> do this?</p>\n\n<p>Minor rant: It's amazing how massive the headache is compared to how conceptually simple the problem (need to enable one setting and can't) is. Given that <a href=\"http://www.squaretrade.com/htm/pdf/cell_phone_comparison_study_nov_10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">drop damage is the most common cause of accidental smartphone failure</a> and that USB debugging is required to transfer system data (for some reason the Android folks tied the concept of \"transferring data\" to \"development tool\"), it boggles the mind why there isn't a more robust interface for this or at least a non-arcane working how-to out there somewhere for people who reasonably don't want to spend a week of their life becoming an expert on Android kernel image development and debugging.</p>\n","viewcount":2789,"dups":[],"title":"Enable USB debugging on Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD Global with no screen","tags":["adb","data-recovery","fastboot","usb-debugging","motorola-droid-razr"],"userid":"46219","related":["36860","51536","12834","36224"],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-11-15T01:33:17.550","favoritecount":1,"comments":["77478","77479","77501","77502","77504","77544","77558","77561","77566","77570","77579","77581","77583","77589","99033"]},"2790":{"body":"<p>So I try to send a tweet from hootsuite about this really nice beer I had.

The information on rooting Android devices seems heavily fragmented across the web and the tools unreliable.  At least in my case, <em>SuperOneClick</em> has proven a complete misnomer.  So I'd like to go back to basics - executing as many of the commands as possible from a Linux terminal to get the phone rooted/unlocked/whatever else has to happen to get Cyanogenmod installed.  The two constraints I'm working with here are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The device is running Android <code>2.2.1</code> (I downgraded from <code>2.3.x</code> using the <code>PASSIMG</code> method).</li>\n<li>The power button on the device is broken, so any method which requires pressing/holding it is ruled out.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The problem I am having is that even after following Linux-centric guides, I get to the point of installing the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noshufou.android.su&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">SuperUser</a> app followed by the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">ROM Manager</a> app, but I'm never prompted to give ROM Manager superuser permissions and so can't flash the ClockworkMod recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Below I describe the steps I've been taking so far, based on the <a href=\"http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/how-to-root-nexus-one-running-android-2-2-1-from-ubuntu-linux/\" rel=\"nofollow\">How To Root Nexus One Running Android 2.2.1 From Ubuntu Linux</a> guide.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Download/extract/move <a href=\"http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nexus_one_softroot.tar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nexus One Softroot files</a> to same directory as <code>adb</code></li>\n<li><p>From <code>adb</code> directory, execute the following commands:  </p>\n\n<p>sudo ./adb push psneuter /data/local/tmp/psneuter<br>\nsudo ./adb push busybox /data/local/tmp/busybox<br>\nsudo ./adb push su /data/local/tmp/su<br>\nsudo ./adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/psneuter<br>\nsudo ./adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/busybox<br>\nsudo ./adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/su<br>\nsudo ./adb shell cd /data/local/tmp ./psneuter<br>\nsudo ./adb shell</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After executing <code>sudo ./adb shell</code> as above, I get the <code>#</code> prompt, which is purported to indicate that rooting was successful.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Still following the guide, I then execute the commands which purportedly make root permanent:</p>\n\n<p>mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system<br>\ncd /data/local/tmp<br>\n./busybox cp busybox /system/bin<br>\nchmod 4755 /system/bin/busybox<br>\nbusybox cp su /system/bin<br>\nchmod 4755 /system/bin/su<br>\nexit<br>\nexit   </p></li>\n<li><p>Again, still following the guide, I execute the commands which purportedly set the <code>/system</code> partition back to read-only:</p>\n\n<p>sudo ./adb shell<br>\nsu<br>\nmount -o remount,ro -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system<br>\nexit<br>\nexit  </p></li>\n<li><p>Now, I download the <em>SuperUser</em> app from the Android Market and open it to make sure it's running.</p></li>\n<li>Next, I download the ROM Manager app from Google Play (looks like it pulled a sneaky and upgraded from Android Market to Google Play here).  </li>\n<li>I run ROM Manager and choose <em>Flash ClockworkMod Recovery</em>.  I'm prompted to confirm the phone is a Google Nexus One and then ROM Manager runs for about 30 seconds (yellow program bar goes all the way) before spitting out <em>An error occurred while attempting to run privileged commands!</em>.  And this is the point I am stuck at.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I should note that at no point am I prompted by the SuperUser app to give the ROM Manager app super user permissions.  I don't restart the phone or do anything else throughout all of the steps I've described above, so I can't see any reason for root to have been lost at any point.  In fact, if I execute the command <code>sudo ./adb shell</code> after all this, I still get the <code>#</code> prompt indicating root.  And when I execute <code>id</code> afterwards, I get <code>uid=0(root) gid=0(root)</code> -- further confirmation of root.  I really am stuck on this one.  I've spent a lot of time digging through forum posts and online articles, but the signal to noise ratio is poor and I haven't been able to find anything that actually works.

As well as the bottom explaining my device &amp; set up.</em></p>\n\n<p>The best method I would think of, to do this, would obviously be to do this after a factory restore, and data wipe. But considering I am way past that point, I am trying to find another method. </p>\n\n<p>I already backup all the applications I need, using Titanium Backup, so I don't want to backup my apps that will probably be different at the point of recovery, or will have certain apps I ditched before the point of restore, or have certain configurations I don't use/need/etc. I could go on and on. But the point Is I would just like to backup my stock rom, kernel, with my Super User privileges, without anything else. So I can basically use it as a factory reset, by just flashing my rom. </p>\n\n<p>The main reason I ask this, is because I tend to get big into customization. Recently I used a font installer, form Rom Toolbox, and basically bricked my phone by getting caught in a boot loop. It would never pass to boot animation. So I had to use an old Odin Image with Clockwork Recovery. That was all I had. Luckily that fixed it, but I would like to make my own recovery images.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But, really the best thing I would just love, yet I am not sure whether it is possible, or as customizable, is it would be great if their was a way to just pick and choose what you want, or don't want to backup to a single image file.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Like an application that lets you choose certain things: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>System</li>\n<li>Root</li>\n<li>Kernel</li>\n<li>Applications with or without caches, data, accounts, and settings, etc.</li>\n<li>System Settings</li>\n<li>Account Settings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...you get the point...</p>\n\n<p>Now there wouldn't happen to be something like this for backups would there? Or is that just a dream of mine? </p>\n\n<p>Even though right now, I would prefer to just backup only my system without everything else, like apps. Maybe one day in the future I may like to be able to backup other things as well. Which is why I ask. Might as well use a \"one backup to rule them all\" method if it exists. But if not that's fine, I could always just backup the system itself, and continue to use Titanium.</p>\n\n<p>Now that, that is covered, what are all the different methods of backups? Odin. Nandroid. Anything else? What do they cover, and how customizable, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Ive been looking into this for the past week, but I am having trouble finding something that is relevant to what I am looking for. And all the information regarding backups seems quite specific to certain devices, and custom roms. \nWhich puts me kind of at a fallback, as I have a pretty uncommon device, with a pretty default rom. </p>\n\n<p>I have a Samsung Conquer 4G (SPH-D600) With the FE16 firmware update, on a stock rom with root, with a slight mod of having ClockworkMod Recovery. </p>\n\n<p>So when I press and hold the: \"Volume Down, &amp; Power button\" it takes me to a \"ClockworkMod based recovery mode\" (according to what it says on the header on the screen.) </p>\n\n<p>So that's what I am working with. </p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts on this selective backup utilities I am thinking off? Any good resources I should look into on this topic? as well as any other information you may find relevant to this situation that you would care to share? </p>\n\n<p>I would greatly appreciate any input on the subject, as android backups aren't a topic I know much of anything on, and cant really find any good resources on the subject myself. \nSo any and all help is appreciated. Even just links are great.

I tried to get a Motorola H350 headset to work, but it failed. Then I tried a Sprint Jawbone headset and it synced, but in Skype the microphone in it didn't work and it was using the microphone on the Galaxy Tab instead. I mean, I walked away from my tab and said \"testing 1, 2, 3\", and couldn't hear it. Instead, I heard someone near my tab saying, \"testing a, b, c\".</p>\n\n<p>Second, I don't know if it's just a Skype issue or the Galaxy Tab hardware that's preventing Skype from picking up my voice over the paired bluetooth headset. Or perhaps it's the headset. Or perhaps I must use only a Samsung-brand headset.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, I want to use Skype calling on my Galaxy tab, and purchase a headset that lets me use the microphone in the headset.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone gotten this to work? What's the trick?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I have since purchased <a href=\"http://amzn.com/dp/B004FGNUH0/?tag=bettelearn-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">these wireless headphones</a> which also include a built-in mic. These sync'd up for audio output, but in Skype I could not get audio input. So, I then temporarily rooted my device (thank you z4 root tool) and edited /system/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf to enable some settings that Verizon Wireless and/or Samsung disables in the unit. I then reset the unit and did the headset repairing again. In the end, Skype would not do audio input from the headset. But I noticed this, however. The microphone on the Galaxy Tab is outstanding. It collects the audio input in such a way that drowns out background sound.
