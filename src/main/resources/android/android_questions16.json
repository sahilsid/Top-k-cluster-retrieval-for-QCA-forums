I'm Hungarian and our alphabet contains special letters like 'á', 'ő', 'ú' and so on. As you can see each basic letter has a single or a double accent on the top of it (or a dot). If that accent leans to the right like this: 'á' then only 70 letters are allowed to send in a single SMS message.

I am connecting the mobile to my PC and choose LG Software mode(read this in a blog that had discussion about LG Optimus). The USB Debugging option in Developer Options is greyed out. Once i unplug it, it glows and I enable it but when I connect and try to debug,my eclipse does not identify the device. Any help will be much appreciated. </p>\n","viewcount":1500,"dups":[],"title":"Unable to debug in LG Optimis L7","tags":["debug","lg-optimus-l7-2"],"userid":"48768","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["59330"],"acceptedanswer":"59330","creationdate":"2013-12-19T09:57:05.127","favoritecount":0,"comments":["80517","80519","80520","80529","80540","80545"]},"59300":{"body":"<p>When i install apps ,that i take from my friends , it seems quite fishy , so how to check that the apps are trusted or not.</p>\n","viewcount":31,"dups":[],"title":"How i can protect my android from Master Key Vulneralability?","tags":["security"],"userid":"48757","related":["58579"],"score":0,"answers":["59302"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-12-19T08:02:51.267","favoritecount":0,"comments":["95298"]},"59303":{"body":"<p>I just took delivery of a <a href=\"http://thermodo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermodo</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robocat/thermodo-the-tiny-thermometer-for-mobile-devices\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kickstarter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Their website states that a Thermodo app is coming soon for Android but their <a href=\"http://store.thermodo.com/pages/what-is-thermodo\" rel=\"nofollow\">What Is</a> page says it should work with their existing app, <a href=\"http://thermo.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I can't get it to recognise the Thermodo.

I suspected that battery-usage during idle time could be improved. So the next night (7 hours) I put my Nexus into airplane mode, and the next morning the battery had only used 1% for those 7 hours, which proved that there was room for improvement.<br>\nNext I disabled bluetooth and set wi-fi, to be disabled when the screen is locked (changed \"Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep\" from \"Always\" to \"Only when plugged in\").

(The folder is <code>/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0</code> instead of <code>/usr/share/doc/openvpn-2.0/easy-rsa</code>, for instance, and there's a <code>vars</code>, but no <code>init-config</code> script.)

The router server starts now and says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Name  Value\n  Max bcast/mcast queue length  0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>under Status.

Then I went to Settings → Location &amp; security → Install from SD card, and was able to install the CA certificate, added a password, etc.  Trying to add the htc_g2 or server certificates did not work, saying \"no certificate to install\".  I edited the files and removed everything before <code>-----BEGIN</code>, and then they installed.  In \"Add OpenVPN VPN\", I selected the \"ca\" certificate for \"Set CA certificate\", and the htc_g2 certificate for \"Set user certificate\".
