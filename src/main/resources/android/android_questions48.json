I also explored in that question what options were available to sync only to local computers, and to <em>definitively</em> prevent the device from syncing private data (calendar, contacts, todos) to Google. I plan to do my own backups locally.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: not syncing private data with Google is a little trickier than a new user would expect. This is because a Google account is required to use the marketplace, and once the phone has that account, it cannot be removed without a factory reset (at least in version 2.2). The sync to it <em>can</em> be disabled, but if one accidentally turns it on - easily done momentarily, in my view - contacts and calendar are likely to whoosh to the cloud in short order.</p>\n\n<p>One of course has to balance security requirements with usability, and my favourite calendars thus far (Business Calendar, aCalendar) do not offer their own private calendar repositories (they just work with any calendar sync provider). Ergo, they are equally at risk of accidental cloud synching as the stock Calendar application.</p>\n\n<p>So, I am wondering if rooting the device and installing a firewall would be the way to go? I was originally of the view that I could grant application permissions to Market/Play to contact Google, but not Calendar. However I see in the DroidWall FAQ, if one wishes to continue using the market after installing the firewall:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Enable the following applications:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>\"Market\";</li>\n  <li>\"Media Storage, DRM Protected Content Storage, Download Manager\" and</li>\n  <li>\"Calendar Sync Adapter, Google Services Framework, Contacts Sync Adapter\"</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems odd that, to use the market one needs to grant permissions to the latter, but would be entirely in keeping with Google's policy of making it hard to avoid their services. Any root owners here have thoughts as to whether it is possible? I'm hoping I can filter+block on <code>calendar.google.com</code> etc whilst permitting <code>play.google.com</code> - or similar.</p>\n\n<p>(I suppose the easiest answer to this Q is \"try it!\", but I'm looking for expertise before I risk rooting my phone).</p>\n","viewcount":2885,"dups":[],"title":"Can Google services be firewall-filtered (market yes, sync no)?","tags":["sync","root","firewall","google-play-services"],"userid":"15844","related":["8260","24041","8598"],"score":0,"answers":["24730"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-06-24T13:58:18.483","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"50653":{"body":"<p>Device: Samsung Galaxy S3</p>\n\n<p>A person I followed had a cool video they posted on Instagram, but then deleted it later.
