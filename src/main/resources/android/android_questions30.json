That's what RAM is for. But please, my Sony Xperia SP has 1GB RAM, which is I think should absolutely be enough for the tasks that my phone needs to handle, but it's intensely abused by factory Android and factory applications.</p>\n\n<p>I only use a few apps on my phone: Gmail, Hangouts, Chrome, Spotify, Calendar and NewsBlur.</p>\n\n<p>Some really annoying things that occur on regular daily usage, and can easily be reproduced:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I open a news page in Chrome, which has a couple high resolution photos - but nothing extremely much, maybe a few tens of megabytes uncompressed image data. (Or a few megabytes compressed). And boom! Chrome disappears instantly!</li>\n<li>I'm typing a message on a web service, or fill basically any form on any website, that consist more that a few paragpraphs without images - either the browser or the keyboard application disappears randomly. On some websites, it impossible to type a full sentence. Does not matter if I use the factory keyboard, or SwiftKey.</li>\n<li>It's essentially impossible to listen to music and browse the web at the same time. One of the applications gets killed after a short while.</li>\n<li>Sometimes can't even text and listen to music at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since my old Sony Ericsson cellphone could handle all of these without any problem ever, with one quarter of this memory, or so, I think either something is wrong with my phone, or it's firmware is totally unusable. I lean towards the second one, since my girlfriend's Sony phone has the same issues. And also, I don't think it's a hardware problem, since other applications run totally smoothly and with zero problem. NewsBlur and Calendar works perfectly, and I've tried installing some performance-hungry games, all of them run perfectly fine and smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>I tried many things. Factory reset did not help, disabling 90% of all applications did not help, trying different keyboard software, music player, browser did not help much. I removed all the applications that I don't use on a daily basis, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If I use a lightweight homescreen instead of the factory one, and switch to Dolphin browser or Opera Mini, things get a <em>little</em> better, but each problem happens on a daily basis anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I have up-to-date firmware and applications.</p>\n\n<p>What annoying is that Android seems to keep applications cached like homescreen, Play Store, etc. It's great that homescreen loads instantly, but I don't mind it killed, if that's required to keep keyboard in memory (while I'm typing, at least!)</p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong? Is this normal? (It should not be...) Should I send a warranty claim?</p>\n\n<p>I think it should work for so simple tasks out of the box, but I'm open to anything that helps. Unfortunately, on Google and Sony support forums I could not find anything aside clearing application data and using less applications. I already use less applications that I've used on my non-smartphone, and clearing application data did only rarefied the issues very little, and then everything went back to \"normal\", after a day or so.</p>\n\n<p>So clearing application data does not really solve the problem. Also, I don't want useful information to be lost, so I think clearing application data regularly is not an option. For me, it seems that factory applications are so poorly designed, that they prefer loading huge amount of unimportant information to RAM, and killing really important applications to make space for it. And there is always still at least 150-200 megabytes of RAM left, when applications start to get killed...</p>\n","viewcount":100,"dups":[],"title":"My phone handles RAM utterly wrong","tags":["keyboard","ram","warranty"],"userid":"57419","related":[],"score":0,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-03-31T09:39:16.513","favoritecount":0,"comments":["89963","89964","90025"]},"66576":{"body":"<p>I know we can use the teamviewer app to connect to PC using internet connection for remote desktop connection.</p>\n\n<p>But I want to know if it is possible to connect the PC with Phone using the Wifi connection.

And I have downloaded and installed Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>Normally when I take pictures on the stock Camera app, my photos gets sent to <strong>sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO</strong>. However, when I installed Instagram and started to use it, I notice that it created a new folder under <strong>sdcard/DCIM</strong> and called it <strong>Camera</strong> and that is where it places the pictures I take inside the app. What's worse is that, aside from creating the <strong>sdcard/DCIM/Camera</strong> folder, it also creates the same image inside <strong>sdcard/DCIM/100ANDRO</strong>. So whenever I take an Instagram photo, that picture gets 2 copies plus the third one with the applied filters on a separate folder called <strong>Instagram</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This may not have been an issue because I can always clear the <strong>sdcard/DCIM/Camera</strong> folder every after some time.

I am looking for ideas as to what to try next.</p>\n\n<p>The phone has been obtained from eBay and seems to be of no-name Chinese manufacture. It has 2GB of RAM and a 4-core CPU. It has three SIM ports, two cameras, a 2800 mAh battery, and all the usual wifi/bluetooth/GPS/gyro interfaces. The screen is approximately 6 x 2.5\" in size and supports full HD. It is running Android 4.2.1 (I believe this is Jelly Bean).</p>\n\n<p>I am told that the rear camera used to work, but now no longer does - I am wondering whether my friend received an Android update via her provider, which stopped it working. The front camera seems to work, although (since I am not used to large-screen devices) it seems to be permanently auto-focusing and clicking every few seconds. I don't know whether this is a feature or a fault!</p>\n\n<p>Having done some research, I believe a \"swirl\" arrows icon should appear superimposed on any live camera image to toggle between camera devices, but I cannot see this anywhere. I have tried the following apps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Camera (stock app) - front camera works fine, no way to switch to rear camera</li>\n<li>HD Camera Ultra - crashes</li>\n<li>Camera (downloaded) - only front camera</li>\n<li>Dual Camera / Double Shot - crashes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of the crashy apps seem to have a lot of Play reviews, so I am minded to think there is a problem on my device specifically, rather than just that these apps are of low quality.</p>\n\n<p>I notice that if I put Camera (the non-stock version) into Panorama mode, it tries to connect to the rear camera, whereas for movie and pictures it uses the front camera. However it seems to fail to connect to the rear camera:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Camera error</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Can't connect to the camera.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect this is a good sign - it is perhaps \"half connected\"!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I wondered if it just needed a factory reset, so I have done one, taking it back to \"here's a demo of your device\" state. However this hasn't made any difference.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts on the reasons why I cannot get this to work:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The rear camera has developed a hardware fault</li>\n<li>The whole phone is fussy about what version of Android it uses and/or &mdash; given that it is unbranded &mdash; has not been tested as well as it should have been</li>\n<li>The front camera is stuck repeatedly auto-focusing and as a result does not give the rear camera an opportunity to initialise (update: I don't think this is the case now; if I hold the phone far enough away, and focus on something in good light, the focus box goes green and the front camera stops auto-focusing)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few things that might be worth a try:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Find a test (camera) app to give me techie info about the devices the phone can detect. I have looked for such a thing but cannot find one</li>\n<li>Do a hard reset with a pinhole switch, though I cannot find one, and presume this is not an option</li>\n<li>Downgrade Android an official way (using my SIM). This might bring the camera back to life, but possibly it may be overwritten when my friend puts her SIM back in</li>\n<li>Upgrade Android the approved way. Using my SIM I have searched the Play store for \"upgrade Android\" but cannot find anything useful. I believe (from material on the web) there should be an upgrade option in \"About this phone\" but I don't seem to have that</li>\n<li>Root the phone and try a later minor version</li>\n<li>Root the phone and try a later major version</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I haven't asked whether my friend would mind me rooting the phone, but I am given to believe it is safe these days.

The partial list is CSipSimple, S.MS, TouchDown email, which all do \"run at startup\"; but so does Facebook and there is no issue with that.
