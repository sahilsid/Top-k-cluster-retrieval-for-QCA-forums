There is not a single reference to \"CDC Serial\". I'm not an expert, but I do understand some of this. The \"USB Composite Device\" is installed so that Windows can communicate with the phone over the USB cable. The \"Galaxy S4 (sg)\" is the name I gave to my phone during setup, and this is the device that presents itself to Windows as a media player, makes use of the MTP protocol, and this is what shows up in Windows Explorer.</p>\n\n<p>How am I supposed to know what \"CDC Serial\" is if it's not described in the user's manual? I have never seen that before on any Android device when connected to a PC. I did a search for \"cdc serial\" on Google and all I could find was people doing some hacks to their phones, like rooting, changing ROM, and generally just hacking it.</p>\n\n<p>So what if I don't want to do any of that? Is it still important to configure the \"CDC Serial\" device? How does it impact the functionality of the phone, e.g. when syncing data between the phone and the PC, if I decide I don't want to follow those hacking tips and tricks to try to install this device?</p>\n\n<p>I contacted Samsung Technical Support about this and they had no clue what I was talking about. They said they would look into it, but that's it. No help at all.</p>\n\n<p>The user's manual says I can change the USB connection type from MTP to PTP. It essentially makes the phone present itself to Windows as a still camera device. I tried that there were no issues with drivers not being installed. Windows detected only the \"Galaxy S4 (sg)\" device and it was automatically configured and installed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jB7WN.png\" alt=\"b\"></p>\n\n<p>In this mode, only picture files can be transferred between the phone and the PC.

I already found a few solutions, but they all have small shortcomings, so I'm still looking for the perfect solution:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vu.de.urpool.quickdroid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quickdroid</a>: This Open Source app can search apps, contacts, music and a few other things. It also provides a 'quick launch' by adding a permanent notification to open Quickdroid. However it still feels as not fast enough, as you have to open the notification drawer, search for the quickdroid notification and touch it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ligi.fast\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAST App Search</a>: This is a much simpler app (also Open Source), which only searches apps (no contacts etc, so that's it's weak point). It can however be configured to launch when dragging the home button from the bottom up to the center of the screen, thereby replacing Google Now.</li>\n<li>Google Now: When dragging the home button up, the Nexus 7 will by default launch Google Now. This actually searches for apps, music, contacts etc and applications can add 'catalogs' to it. So in fact this is pretty much what I'm looking for. The problem here is that (1) After opening Google Now you need to tap the search field before you can start typing, (2) because of the google search suggestions, the actual matching applications are hidden behind the onscreen keyboard and (3) to really search all the 'catalogs' you need to tap 'search tablet'.</li>\n<li>Google from homescreen: I can also press the google search button on the homescreen of the Nexus 7. The result is similar to opening Google Now, except that the search field immediately gets the cursor-focus. This obviously adds another step because you have to make the homescreen visible, and doesn't solve the search suggestions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is it possible to configure the 'drag the home button up'-action, to launch the google search, with the search field focused and immediately in tablet-search modus? This certainly feels like the best solution as it is already part of Android and apps can extend it by adding content.<br>\nOr are there other similar apps that can be configured to launch by a single tap/drag and search for apps, contacts, music, etc?</p>\n","viewcount":1634,"dups":[],"title":"Looking for a launcher similar to Launchy, Synapse or Kupfer (with type to find and launch app feature)","tags":["launcher","search"],"userid":"29155","related":[],"score":3,"answers":["41018","41016","40976","67914","40955","41064","62911"],"acceptedanswer":"41064","creationdate":"2013-02-26T22:02:22.163","favoritecount":0,"comments":["54760","54816","54819","57139","57251"]},"29962":{"body":"<p>The reason for the question is that I have a friend with an iPhone who sends emoticons, and I receive them as a single rectangular box.

I would like to access the same appointments and tasks from the phone and, importantly,\nhave the reminders synchronized. To clarify, I would like to be able to snooze a task from my PC at 6pm for 2 hours, leave\nhome for at least 2 hours, and have the task popup on my phone at 8pm with a similar prompt to snooze. So, I'm looking for a fairly\ncomplete synchronization effect between the PC and the phone.</p>\n\n<p>So, to do this, I obviously need a shared service (Google Calendar, etc.) or a shared file (iCalendar, CalDAV) on a server\nthat both my phone and PC can access. One knock against Google Calendar is that tasks are deficient compared to tasks on\nWindows Calendar. Google Calendar tasks don't have reminders (and, therefore, nothing to snooze), so I have ruled Google Calendar out.\nI'm not familiar with other SaaS calendaring/task offerings (Microsoft, etc.)...maybe someone could advise if they handle\ntasks more like Windows Calendar.</p>\n\n<p>On the phone, there is a calendar built into Android which is pretty close to what I want for a native client. Popups for\nreminders, though, have no snooze duration. So, I can't choose how long I want it to snooze. This is fairly significant\nbecause I routinely snooze one task for 5 minutes and snooze another task for 1 week. So, I need a client on my phone\nthat has this type of functionality. Furthermore, I need a client that will connect to the \"shared\" service/file that I\nmentioned earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Am I stretching the limits of the SaaS offerings out there and the available native clients too much that I now need to write\nmy own Android client? I'm not sure about Windows Calendar \"automatic synchronization\", so I'm flexible enough to accept\nchanging to a client like Mozilla Lightning, if necessary. I have tested Mozilla Lightning and it synchronizes (appointments)\nwell with Google Calendar, for example.\nAny advice for my problem?</p>\n","viewcount":155,"dups":[],"title":"sync android calendar (tasks) with calendar from PC","tags":["sync","calendar"],"userid":"39689","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["64339"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-02-25T14:55:59.930","favoritecount":0,"comments":[]},"52743":{"body":"<p>In my old phone I had a setting called \"Area Info - cell information\".
