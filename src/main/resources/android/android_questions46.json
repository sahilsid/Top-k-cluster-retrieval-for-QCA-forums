As in that question, some device info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's a BLU ADVANCE 4.0</li>\n<li>Board is Mediatek MT6572</li>\n<li>Android version is 4.2.2</li>\n<li>Kernel version is 3.4.5</li>\n<li>I do have root access</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've been trying to take a backup of certain partitions on my phone (boot.img, system.img, recovery.img) but I've run into some problems.</p>\n\n<p>I've found backups online for this model, taken backups with MTK Droid Root and Tools and tried to read directly from /dev/bootimg and /dev/recovery. I've run into a few different issues. There are three main ones and I include them all here as I think they're related. I'm going to start with the one that's consistent across all of these:</p>\n\n<h2>Issue #1</h2>\n\n<p>The kernel part of my boot.img seems to be way too small (about 18.0KiB - that's not right, is it?) and ends with a bunch of error messages before the GZIP 1F8B that I think marks the start of the ramdisk. Here are the messages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System halted.\nAttempting division by 0!...\nUncompressing Linux.....\ndecompressor returned an error.. \ndone, booting the kernel...\ninvalid distance too far back...\ninvalid distance code...\ninvalid literal/length code.\nincorrect header check..\nunknown compression method..\ninvalid window size.invalid block type..\ninvalid stored block lengths....\ntoo many length or distance symbols.\ninvalid code lengths set....\ninvalid bit length repeat...\ninvalid literal/lengths set.\ninvalid distances set...\nincorrect data check....\nOut of memory while allocating output buffer....\nOut of memory while allocating input buffer.\nOut of memory while allocating z_stream.\nOut of memory while allocating workspace....\nNot a gzip file.\nheader error....\nread error..\nuncompression error........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The newlines are from me, I tried to format it as best I could. I'm a little confused about what's going on here as I'm just reading the image - there shouldn't be error messages. Am I just seeing lists of possible errors in the kernel?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Issue #2</h2>\n\n<p>I can't extract the contents of the ramdisk in the properly sized kernels (I want to check that the backups worked properly) as in <a href=\"http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=HOWTO%3a_Unpack,_Edit,_and_Re-Pack_Boot_Images.\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guide to unpacking boot images</a>\nWhen I run this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gunzip -c ../your-ramdisk-file | cpio -i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the following messages (a whole bunch like the first and finishing with the last two):</p>\n\n<pre><code>cpio: Malformed number (�K�����\ngzip: ../ramdisk.gz: decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored\ncpio: premature end of file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and no new file outputted. Note that I can unzip the file by omitting the cpio bit and redirecting the output and it will produce a file containing some recognizable text in a hex editor, so I assume the extraction was successful.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Issue #3</h2>\n\n<p>The boot.img read from /dev/bootimg, though it seems to be valid at the start, is way, way too big - I stopped it at 3.0GiB+. For reference the one I found online and the one I generated with MTK Droid Tools and Root are 6.0MiB. By truncating it to 500MiB I was able to find the same kernel structure as in the other ones, though I wasn't sure where the ramdisk ended so couldn't reliably check that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I suppose my question is basically: what is wrong with my boot.img?

I was recording an important video with my smartphone (the default video recorder) and then I put the cellphone close to my chest. I noticed later that the video stopped but i thought it was saved. seems like somehow the jacket touched a cancel button (not delete) and then ok. odd but it happened.\nnow i dont find the video.\nMy question is if anyone knows if i have any chance to recover the video from a place in the SD memory, probaly using an forensic tool to recover deleted files. I mean if the data was being created somewhere in a temp file until its done, It could be recovered but as this is android i dont have idea.\nThe video was important so I'll try anything.\nNOTE: checking in windows, it shows the modification date in the folder DCIM\\Camera, corresponding to the moment i was recording. So at least there was access to that specific folder.</p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n","viewcount":143,"dups":[],"title":"Do I have any chance to recover this video?","tags":["video","data-recovery","delete"],"userid":"15549","related":["15869"],"score":2,"answers":["47682","47693"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2013-06-21T02:07:25.927","favoritecount":0,"comments":["64215"]},"48908":{"body":"<p>How can I get an old version of the YouTube application for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2?

I tried it on an sms to see if it would work. It didn't but from then on the sms app started two threads, in a seemingly random way: most of the received sms are listed under a number starting with *131*001 that I cannot reply to. In the process all the past sms conversations were \"captured\" and listed under that number. To send sms I had to start a new thread with the same number but without *131*001.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I tried: first, I added *131*001etc as an additional number for my contact, hoping that the threads would be merged. But it did nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, after reading some, I used SMSBackupAndRestore to save the sms and modify the resulting xml file. I noticed one difference between the sms in the two different threads, namely, a difference in the service_center, for instance service_center=\"+852161645501\" for the sms listed as *131*001etc and service_center=\"null\" for the properly listed sms. So I replaced every instance of service_center=\"+852161645501\" (numbers varied) with service_center=\"null\". I then reloaded the modified xml file using SMSBackupAndRestore.</p>\n\n<p>Before the \"fix\" just described, I had about 2,000 messages listed under *131*001etc and about 5 or 6 listed under the correct number. After the \"fix\", I had two more or less evenly split lists, of about 1,000 messages each. Plus a third list got created with 2 messages in it.</p>\n\n<p>As I was doing this, it occurred to me that SMSBackupAndRestore only saves the text of the sms, not the pictures and other attachments. Yet, the pictures and attachments were showing up after applying the \"fix\", showing that the sms had not really been deleted, merely taken off the directory and upon being re-loaded the android sms app would \"recognize\" the messages and re-load the pictures and attachments. This means that there is a folder somewhere with the history of my sms. And the android sms app is using information stored there to recreate the *131*001etc thread that I'm trying to delete.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to delete all the cache. I couldn't find it by browsing (I'm using Windows 7), so I downloaded some apps to help me, two apps named 1tap cleaner, both worked in a similar way and deleted cache, but obviously not the cache I want to delete since it hasn't solved anything.</p>\n\n<p>I have deleted all the sms, but double threads listed as *131*001etc still happen with the new messages. Plus now I can't even add a picture to my contacts (when I \"edit\" the contact, I can only edit the name and number, nothing else)...</p>\n\n<p>Handcent hasn't helped.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on how to get out of this nightmare? many thanks.</p>\n","viewcount":702,"dups":[],"title":"stock sms client creates multiple threads for the same number","tags":["samsung-galaxy-s","2.3-gingerbread","sms"],"userid":"12393","related":[],"score":2,"answers":[],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2012-02-09T20:55:15.363","favoritecount":0,"comments":["22357","22398"]},"60518":{"body":"<p>How do i transfer files from my android smartphone to windows laptop ?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE : Bluetooth is working fine on both the devices and is in ON mode. </p>\n","viewcount":13716,"dups":[],"title":"How do i transfer files from my android smartphone to windows laptop?","tags":["file-transfer"],"userid":"48750","related":[],"score":1,"answers":["60540","60541","60531","60519"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-01-06T04:50:43.010","favoritecount":0,"comments":["81932"]},"60513":{"body":"<p>I need to use a wired microphone to run a ham radio application that allows sound to go into the note 3 and sound out as well.
