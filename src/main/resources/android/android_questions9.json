It looks like it has been factory-reset, and I suppose that one of my corporate accounts has reacted on accidental lock-screen PIN input. (Having tried it today, I can't exactly understand how that was possible, but let's assume that's just the case.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem (which I was not aware of that it IS a problem) is that I was offline (roaming) when I noticed. I needed my phone, so I skipped the Wifi setup because my phone just told me it could not verify my software was up to date. I'm on 4.4.4, so I knew it was up to date.</p>\n\n<p>Then, even after logging in to Gmail, Play Store etc., I was unable to get the Google backup restored. Wifi passwords, apps, home screen layout, app settings, that kind of stuff. I suspected that the only possibility to restore a backup is when the phone is first turned on after a reset and I might have lost that opportunity. So I did another factory reset (this time near my Wifi) and voilà, I could login and chose to restore the backup.</p>\n\n<p>BUT: this restore restored what I had installed after the first factory reset.

Typically, I leave the phones plugged in overnight, or else I lose these configurations and I have to redo them.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, when I get in the next morning, some of the lights above the ports on the powered USB hub are off.  The phones connected to these ports are no longer tethered.  In order to resolve this, I have to disconnect the USB cable, reconnect it, re-tether the phone, and redo the configurations.

In the 59µm x 59µm square, it contains only either Blue or Red. In simple words, repeating the 59µm x 59µm square cannot produce this pattern, isn't it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Answer:</h1>\n\n<p>(As it is closed at the moment, I put my answer here.)</p>\n\n<p>I was about to file a query to Samsung Support. To ask better questions, I re-study <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/samsung-galaxy-s5-oled-pixel-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the webpage</a> again, and I came across <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/galaxy-s5-amoled-display-tested-in-the-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> having the table below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6gnBG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In the row of \"Sub-Pixels Per Inch\", we can see that only green pixels are having 432 ppi. Both red and blue pixels are at only 305 ppi.</p>\n\n<p>Doing a few maths:</p>\n\n<p>$$\nClosest\\ (inclined)\\ distance\\ between\\ red\\ pixels = \\sqrt{(118µm/2)^2 + (118µm/2)^2} = 83.439 µm\n$$\n$$\n83.439 µm = 0.00328498426 inches\n$$\n$$\nPPI_{red} = PPI_{blue} = \\frac{1}{0.00328498426 inches} = 304.415 ppi \\approx 305 ppi\n$$</p>\n\n<p>This table verifies our PPI calculations and definition. According to these figures, <strong>pixel distance</strong> that is used to calculate the PPI should have been defined as <strong>the closest distance between two dots of the same colour, which can be independently turned on and off</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Is Samsung being tricky? Not exactly.</p>\n\n<p>When I do more researches on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S5\" rel=\"nofollow\">S5</a>, so as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4\" rel=\"nofollow\">S4</a> as they have the same <em>diagonal</em> PenTile RGBG matrix, I got this from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenTile_matrix_family#PenTile_RGBG\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PenTile RGBG layout used in AMOLED and Plasma displays uses green pixels interleaved with alternating red and blue pixels. The human eye is most sensitive to green, especially for high resolution luminance information. <strong>The green subpixels are mapped to input pixels on a one to one basis. The red and blue subpixels are subsampled, reconstructing the chroma signal at a lower resolution.</strong> The luminance signal is processed using adaptive subpixel rendering filters to optimize reconstruction of high spatial frequencies from the input image, wherein the green subpixels provides the majority of the reconstruction. The red and blue subpixels are capable of reconstructing the horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, but not the highest of the diagonal. Diagonal high spatial frequency information in the red and blue channels of the input image are transferred to the green subpixels for image reconstruction. <strong>Thus the RG-BG scheme creates a color display with one third fewer subpixels than a traditional RGB-RGB scheme but with the same measured luminance display resolution.</strong> This is similar to the Bayer filter commonly used in digital cameras.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, we have a few conclusions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The structure and dimensions in the <a href=\"http://news.oled-display.net/samsung-galaxy-s5-oled-pixel-structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">oled-display.net news</a> (it means the image in the question) are correct.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes. S5 AMOLED display does having less than 432 ppi <strong><em>if we focus on red or blue sub-pixels</em></strong>. (They are of 305 ppi only.)</p></li>\n<li><p>However, according to wiki, the perception of resolution depends mainly on the green sub-pixels. So it is having 432 ppi on real-life images. (I believe for pure red and/or blue images, it has only 305 ppi diagonally.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Digital images are displayed at 432 ppi, as they are mapped to the green sub-pixels on 1-to-1 basis. The red and blue sub-pixels are complements.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A side note:</p>\n\n<p>In the last sentence in wiki mentioned our familiar cameras' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bayer filter</a>. After re-studying again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The raw output of Bayer-filter cameras is referred to as a Bayer pattern image. <strong>Since each pixel is filtered to record only one of three colors</strong>, the data from each pixel cannot fully specify each of the red, green, and blue values on its own. To obtain a full-color image, various demosaicing algorithms can be used to interpolate a set of complete red, green, and blue values for each pixel. These algorithms make use of the surrounding pixels of the corresponding colors to estimate the values for a particular pixel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which means the image below is a 8 x 8 pixel sensor (instead of a 4 x 4 or else).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IKXVz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n","viewcount":57,"dups":[],"title":"How large is “one pixel” for S5 AMOLED display?","tags":["screen","samsung-galaxy-s-5","super-amoled"],"userid":"61841","related":[],"score":0,"answers":["71533"],"acceptedanswer":false,"creationdate":"2014-06-04T09:11:54.633","favoritecount":1,"comments":[]},"80904":{"body":"<p>I'm trying to use adb backup command, but adb window just pops up and closes instantly, I've tried doing </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>adb backup -all -apk -shared -system -f D:\\backup.ab > D:\\out.txt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but the file is empty, the size is 0 bytes, so I don't even know what went wrong.
