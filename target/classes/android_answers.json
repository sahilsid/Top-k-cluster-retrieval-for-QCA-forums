This commit fixes ssh\n  and ssh-keygen trying to create /.ssh which is volatile and read-only\n  anyway.</p>\n  \n  <p>To allow an app (e.g. Android Terminal Emulator) to use ssh\n  /data/ssh_client still has to exist and owner permissions need to be\n  set to the app user. This could be fixed by using the real data\n  directory (/data/data/\"app\") in a later commit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "userid": "15713", "comments": [], "score": 2, "parentid": "17258", "creationdate": "2012-08-31T07:55:22.187"},

Ok not pure android there is a lot of stuff modified by the big banners.
